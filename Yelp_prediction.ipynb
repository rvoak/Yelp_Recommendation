      "Wonderful burgers,  excellent onion rings, good service.  Just don't order dessert.  We ordered apple cobbler and was served blueberry bread pudding.  When we questioned if it was apple cobbler our waited assured us it was cobbler. After we ate a few bites... no apple! The waitress told us she has been waiting for a customer to question it.  We still were charged the full $7.00 for a dessert we didn't order or want! Too bad the rest of the meal was great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Visited for Restaurant Week so we had a shared app (crab cake), two entrees (Carolina burger w\\/string fries and fish and \"chips\"\\/string fries) and shared dessert. The waiter was friendly but somewhat unattentive and tried to push the other restaurants\\/deli on to us quite a bit. The food was pretty mediocre but edible..no complaints. I'm not a huge string fry fan so I was hoping for some thicker cut \"chips\". The blueberry bread pudding was okay. It tasted like they used old garlic bread from the other restaurant next door then smothered it in whiskey and butter. We went about 15-20 minutes without a water refill and waited 10 minutes for our card to be picked up. All in all it was just okay but at least now we know and it only cost us $30. I guess that's what Restaurant Week is all about though right?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Was here on a business lunch with a colleague.  I had the Arizona burger.  The bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger, and while good in theory, was ok at best.  Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was the second time I have come to charr. The restaurant is really cool and appealing to the eye. The food is really really good. I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich and on this trip I had the Carolina burger. The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Although happy to find another decent place to eat in the Lovely's hood, this was not a 5 star experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the number of families we saw in there, this does not read as kid friendly. I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up. \n",
      "\n",
      "My flat iron salad had freshly cut romaine, homemade croutons, some bermuda onion, corn and black beans and a slice of tomato that was cut in half. I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with a good portion of sliced flatiron steak that although cooked well, had zero seasoning and the dressing on the side was described as a southwest caesar. I didn't get southwest and I did get blah\\/lacking in flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line, we'd go back but for the burgers only. Cost of the meal for three of us with no drinks, only water, was $40. Its nice that its in the hood and that there is good food but overall it was good, not great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My husband enjoyed his Hawaiian burger.  The barbeque burger was Ok except the barbeque sauce was very sweet.  The server was good but was very touchy feely and kept calling me pet names like \"babe\" and \"sweetheart\" which made me uncomfortable since he was at least 15 years younger than I am.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My wife and I visited Charr with a couple friends for restaurant week this week. We sat out front and waited for our waiter to take our drink orders... And waited... And waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I am giving 3 stars is the food. The Carolina burger was delicious... The sauce and bacon were savory, the garlic knot bun was perfect. Their fries were great and they give you plenty of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend this place for the food, but expect to wait for it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good burger, found this place on IDine.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Easy location. I only wish they were open and delivered at lunch time. The food is very good. I had the 5 cheese sandwich, a cheese lovers dream, and the housemade onion rings. I had ordered a diet coke which was flat. They could not fix it, so I just drank water. The wait staff was friendly, but kind of slow. I thought it was very, very pricey for what you get. The food was very good. I guess it comes down to what are you tradeoffs for good food?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Service good. Atmosphere good. Burgers...to die for. Shrimp Po Boy, overlooked and plain.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was okay... First off, this place is in a strip mall - not the kind of place you expect to be asked \"do you have reservations?\" I think there is a little mismatch here. The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams \"American Bistro\" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local\\/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not \"the check\"), we got everyone's tab on it! WHat a nightmare. The server, who had been inattentive or disorganized all night never got better (hint: you will improve your tips if you don't call the men \"buddy\" and \"bro\" and if you don't call the women \"sweetie.\" Frankly, \"Sir\" and \"Ma'am\" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and \"truffle fries?\" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger.\n",
      "I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good.\n",
      "Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project.\n"

      "Nicholas my subordinate from work suggested that we should try this place because it looked cool.  So we jump into the car and drove a bazillion miles to get here. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place definitely looked cool in person and it was well kept and clean.  The loo was pretty decent as well for a burger joint.  The staff were super friendly and helpful because this was our first time eating here.  Service was good speed, and no mistakes were made. \n",
      "\n",
      "To the food, Nicholas order their signature burger, and we split their mac and cheese... which was absolutely amazing! It's definitely not the best I had, but close enough.. and I highly recommend it.  I also order some wings which was okay, they were really tough to chew. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a good place.  Probably won't come back again since it's so very far.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not so much a review, but a chance to vent about about the negative experience we just had at Charr. The hamburgers are great and they have the best onion rings I've ever tasted. No complaints about the service.\n",
      "Nonetheless, our meal tonight was very uncomfortable. The owner paid for our meal and told us not to come back. \n",
      "The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, \"So you don't make exceptions.\" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, \"Don't come back.\" \n",
      "Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, \"sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good. \n",
      "The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.)\n",
      "I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My boyfriend and I went to Charr for restaurant week. We were a little early for our reservation, so we sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice and lively. I ordered a cocktail off their menu and it was pretty good. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we sat down for our meal it took some time for our server to get to us. She came to us and asked if we had been helped since we already had drinks. I guess the hostess didn't inform her?  We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek..\n",
      "Just like this rating, my experience at Charr was A-Ok.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have been here a few times and the food is always good but the service is totally dependent on whether or not the owner is in the room. If he is walking around the dining room the service is good. If not, good luck getting any food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is the 2nd time being here and the first was okay, I just got a grilled cheese but my friend got a burger and she said it was overcooked. This time I ordered a burger and she got steak sandwich, we both ordered medium rare...I thought that means pink in the middle...well, they both came out well done. Granted they tasted fine, but when you prefer your meat cooked a certain way, you'd hope it is. If you order, order well below how you like your meat, it will likely come out more done then expected. I guess next time I will ask they don't even kill the cow, just embarrass it =-p\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had a Groupon for Charr so my husband and I decided to go there for date night. I loved Aiello's when it was open and I like the Salumeria they have next door. Charr  was decent but not overwhelmingly good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is nice... I like the decor. Most of the servers are attractive young males.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a Moscow Mule which was refreshing and potent. I thought the drinks, including the beer were overpriced.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband ordered the Charr burger, cooked medium rare. He said it came medium well. He still thought the beef tasted good though. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich. It was okay. The aioli that came on it was delicious. The bun that both my sandwich and my husband's burger came on was good and I liked the idea but it came apart on both of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fries were thin and crispy and yummy but our server only brought out one serving for us to share. I noticed other tables of two each had their own serving... hmmmm. Luckily we were more than full despite sharing one serving of fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good except for when my husband had to flag someone down for some mayo after getting our food. It took a solid 5 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our total bill before the Groupon discount for 2 burgers, fries, and 2 alcoholic beverages was around $45. A little overpriced for a burger date night.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will return for happy hour. The drinks were tasty and I am eager to try some of their appetizers.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went on a Monday - an app, two burgers, o-rings and 4 drinks - $72  - We had the Cali burger and turkey burger both good.  The house made o-rings were over battered and too greasy for my taste.  With two of the drinks being on \"Happy Hour\" (note: only seated at the bar or outside) seems pretty expensive for a burger joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had 3 servers standing around but only the bartender did anything - had to flag her down a time or two.  Still seems like they are sorting out things, hopefully pricing is one of them.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They took away my pizza burger,  raised the price of the salmon burger and added a milkshake bar.   Hmmmm.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Best flavor chili chicken wings when not overcooked. Delicious with ranch. I keep going back just for these! Could do with providing finger tip bowls or wipes though, the sauce gets all over your face. Yummy!\n",

      "I was in town for business with a colleague and was recommended this place for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "- oyster shooters: great bloody mary mix, okay oysters\n",
      "- zucchini fries: juicy and fresh, but limp with no crunch. I would pass on this next time\n",
      "- Phoenix burger: a hint of heat, but otherwise meh. The bun is not a normal bun, but rather some sort of knotted bun that fell apart when I bit into it. It was definitely hard to eat. The meat was well-cooked though (hit right on med-rare). Truffle fries were thin and right on. They had perfect crunch\n",
      "- flat iron steak: coworker enjoyed it, as well as the green bean and potato cake side\n",
      "- lemontini: really tasty \n",
      "\n",
      "The bartenders were great. Jill and Mimi were fantastic company. This is a solid place for good conversation and decent food, but definitely not the best burger I've had. I will say it is a place with great value. During their reverse happy hour ($3 well drinks, $3 off appetizers, $5 burgers), our total came out to $60 before tip. That was for 2 oyster shooters, 3 drinks, zucchini fries, phoenix burger, 2 raw oysters, and the flat iron steak. Not bad!\n",

      "Burgers were okay but this place is charging Scottsdale prices in north phoenix.  Happy hour only 3-5 pm and I think reverse as well.  No daily specials, nothing exciting, oysters were priced at $3.50\\/each lol.  Probably one and done here for me as I will gladly enjoy a culvers or paradise valley burger company and go to Scottsdale when I want to pay $13 for a cocktail.  Sorry guys, not worth it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My husband and I went to Charr a few weeks ago.  I purposefully waited to write this since we wanted to re-try a couple of other places nearby for comparison.  We had 2 wedge salads, 2 burgers, an order of onion rings and 3 beers.  $60.  In the next two weeks we went to a nearby sports bar\\/Italian place and a brewpub.  For similar quantities, the price was $35 at one place and $38 at the other, both similar quality.  I have a hard time justifying the higher price tag, especially considering how loud it was at Charr, it was difficult to have a conversation.  The beer selection is good, but overpriced as was the case with everything.  Doing a la carte will be a tough sell when that is not what everyone else does.  We may return but not often unless the value gets better.  I wish them well but would encourage them to consider some changes that will price them more competitively.\n"

      "Ate there last night. Place should be great with nice surroundings, quality ingredients, and diverse menu. Restaurant failed at the two key places. A brand new server who was slow and inefficient was irritating, but the real sin was over cooking the burgers. 4 people at the table ordered medium and 1 was served medium and 3 well done.  I assume the beef was as high quality as everything else, but I had no way to tell with meat that over cooked.\n",

      "Much-needed upscale place in Moon Valley.  Cheated on my standard, Ammacapanne's, 3 times to try this place.  Much better fare, but much worse service.  This most recent visit, the hostess seated us and I asked for a reminder on what the WiFi password was (I'm not a total douche...my wife and I run a small biz together and commonly work over meals and drinks).  The hostess kinda curtly said she didn't know if the place even has WiFi (I knew it did) and didn't know the password if it did.   No effort to go get it.  Finally waited for a server, who vaguely thought she knew it.  I'm not in the HRM industry, except as a consumer, but I can't imagine not training my staff on this.  Love the ambiance and food. Just disappointing service in my 3 visits.\n",

      "Since we loved Aiellos so much, we had to support them and give this place a try! We ordered the Family Dinner to go from Aiello's Salumeria just down the sidewalk, and ate here while waiting for our food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bryan had the green chili burger while I had the pizza burger. We decided to order different ones so we could split and try both. The buns are actually garlic knots or something similar, but they are shaped like cinnabons in which the dough is spiraled all the way to the center. Unique fun idea but man, does this make for a horribly messy burger. You are forced to gobble up the burgers very quickly so they don't fall apart on you. The pizza burger was good, but I liked the chili one more just because there was more flavor to it. It's not that spicy either, so if you're afraid of spice, you are safe to order this chili one. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant and bar are very nice. I loved the dark woods and back lighting. The place is alot more trendy and fun in comparison to the rustic, yet charming older restaurant on Central Avenue close to Camelback. I'm hoping for this place to be a success, but I feel like there are a few more \"things\" that need to be worked out. Even if their burgers are just okay to most people it seems (after reading several previous reviews), let me assure you that their regular Italian food is their specialty and what they're amazing at!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We went fur restaurant week and were neither impressed or disappointed. Just an average burger with less that great service. Meh...\n",

      "Nice patio and good service.  I had the Phoenix burger with truffle fries - both tasty.  I was there for happy hour and told that happy hour only applied to the bar & patio, so I opted for the patio even though I was one of a handful of people there in the middle of the day.  I enjoyed my visit, but wouldn't say it was spectacular.  If I am in the area, I will stop in again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Charr is yet another in a long list of burger restaurants that have sprung up around Phoenix (and across the country). I'm convinced these places justify their high burger prices by adding the descriptor \"gourmet\" to their name, and offering a variety of burger options. Who would have imagined that $10+ for a cheeseburger would be a good deal??\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the American Turkey burger, Charr Burger with cheese, and the kid's meal chicken fingers. We thought the turkey burger was a bit on the dry side. It comes with a garlic aioli, which was flavorful, but there was a lot of it! The cheeseburger was ordered medium, and was more medium-well. It was good, though. The little one loved the chicken fingers and all of us devoured the truffle fries!\n",

      "The Town Square shopping center is a pretty interesting place because the mix of shops & activities is good for locals & tourists.  The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "There is bowling here. It's not bad, enough space for the families to sit around and hang out. The downfall, there was no one working at the bar within the bowling area. Made it difficult for everyone to look after their belongings and children while ordering food and drinks. lol. Enjoy the ugly neon shoes.  \n",

      "We walk in and meet a nice lady where we buy the card with credits. First game we play and it takes our 9 credits and doesn't work. Well that was great. Credits do cost money it's not like we were on some play for so many hours thing. Things were pretty cool from there until we got to the giant fish reel. The reel says we won 70 tickets awesome, the box even says we were awarded 70. So of course since 70 is a lot lets play again. This time the giant reel says we won 60 tickets! Child is super excited and I look down at the box and it says 15 tickets awarded. WHAT?! So I got robbed of 9 credits and at least 45 tickets. Never thought to watch any of the other times we won tickets so who knows how many Game Works really stole from us. It was over all a good time, just left a bad feeling knowing we got ripped off.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had lots of fun here And I truly felt like a kid again! The things that bugged me is that it is very pricey and the tickets compared to the prizes is very expensive! Something I can purchase at the store for maybe $10 cost 1000 tickets or maybe $50 of hard work gaining the tickets. So with that being said if you are in it for the fun and ready to spend lots of money then have at it! The service though was great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "You can go through $100 here in no time, the game prices are very high but the place is a lot of fun and the kids love it. Being in a wheelchair the accessibility is not bad at all. I just wish I could transfer into the games with seating easier. Overall a fun higher priced experience for the family.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a nice addition to Town Square but VERY pricey.  Not enough actual arcade games. And some are already broken or not working yet. Bar and restaurant area is too big, takes up half of the place. Bowling is $5 per game and $4 for shoes. Needs a lot of work to get out all the kinks to make this a great local spot.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Smaller than expected it to be. Not really wowed. There was a bar, which is a plus. But for a Saturday night.. The bar was completely understaffed. This is probably the longest I had to wait for a drink. Which made me a little irritated. Pricing was not bad compared to other places on the strip. Decor is very nice... But they need to staff accordingly!!!!! Not as many games as the previous GAMEWORKS in Vegas. The bathrooms were a little dirty as well. I would come back to see if this would change.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The kids wanted to meet up and hang out with some of their friends so this is place they chose. The games could use some updating, but the air hockey table was where they spent most of there time! This was not your average air hockey table. This was air hockey on steroids. At different times like 20 small pucks would slide down on the table and it was a blast seeing the kids faces light up with excitement! \n",
      "We got here a bit late so we didn't get to try the food, but looking at the pics on Yelp, I may just go back for lunch before we leave Vegas. The bar looked pretty cool as well had 2 pool tables in back, but I was with my kids and holding my littlest man man so no adult activities for daddy. Another cool thing about this place is they had a section with some of the classics, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, just to name a few. All and all the kids had a blast even little guy fun on some riding games.\n",

We have been here a few times and each time of course the kids left very happy (and tired, thankfully). They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer\\/video games. Games for everyone! \n",

Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!! \n",

      "Located in Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd, just South of the Famous Las Vegas Strip. This is an arcade for kids and adults alike. It looks like a great place to throw a party. Although the food is ok, just ok, I had the pizza, it was about the same price as one you could get at CPK, and not nearly as good. But still a fun place and they have a decent happy hour. So I say stop in and try your hand at ski ball. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like going here, but honestly last time was probably my last time there. I feel like there's not enough to do to keep you from being bored. And half the time people have need spilled all over the games.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ate dinner there and I thought it was reasonably priced for Vegas (except for the $9 mozzarella sticks). The food was good. \n",

      "The location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gameworks. When you hear that it should sound like a dream to everyone. The former Gamewirks that was on the Strip was a wonderful attraction. It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new \"Recharge Center\" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games.\n",

      "The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.\n",

For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as \"ground steak\" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.\n",

      "I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13\\/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16\") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine.\n"

      "The first few games we tried had broken controls so we played more of the circus games that you can win tickets to redeem for little trinkets. Those brought back memories of going to the carnival when I was little. My teenage son  decided to go the gaming section which features online computer role playing. the price at 5 per hour seemed very reasonable.  Decided to have lunch at the restaurant. It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people. \n",
      "Overall the area was nice and clean. The bathrooms were clean also.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "First time in a long time since I came back to Gameworks. The last time I've been here was when they had one on the strip next to M&M World.  I've seen nothing new except the bowling and they have billards.  It looked similar to Insert Coins.  Because they have a bar and gaming consoles for you to play on too.  I didn't like the new payment method where you have to get a prepaid card to swipe to play a game.  I like the old fashion pay with quarters.  I like they have an internet cafe where you can LAN party with your friends.  All in all, it's not that bad.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "GameWorks is still the same GameWorks that was on the Strip. The prices are high, the games race car and shooter centric. The kids had a blast running around and playing the games. The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Come here on a weekday! It's a lot less crowded and the service is a bit better. We decided to take my niece and nephew here on a Saturday night and it was really packed. We wanted to get the unlimited game card but you have to dine in to get the deal. I really wish they would just sell the cards without meals coz we didn't really want to eat there. We had to so we did. We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper. She took our name down and our number and said they'll call when a table was ready. So we walk around outside for a bit and when the 30 minutes was up we came back and checked in with the hostess. We waited another 10 minutes then we were finally sat. It seemed like they were short on people. We were sat for quite a bit when a manager finally took our order. The food was ok. We got the nachos and pizza. After that whole process, we finally got our game cards so the kids could play. Nearly all the machines and games were in use. You kind of had to stand by the game you wanted to play and wait for whoever was using it to finish so you can play it next for sure. There was a good selection of games for the small space. I think the kids had fun in the end but they were miserable having to wait for the restaurant and the food and that whole process of getting the game card.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decided to keep kids busy between basketball tournaments. This place is located in the back of Town Square. Plenty of parking and entry is in the front AND back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tables in the dining area were nearly empty. Service was still almost nonexistent! When the waitress did come by, she was very laissez faire. She took orders and some items never came. We were rarely checked on in the few hours there. We didn't get the bill until we asked for it. As infrequently as we got serviced, the waitress is lucky we are honest people! \n",
      "\n",
      "Food is nothing to rave about. Typical quick fried and cooked food: burgers, fries, pizza, appetizers, salads... Plenty of tvs played sports. Plentynof tables for large groups. Side bar area for adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Game room is a bit stuffy. Games could be updated. One side room has a few bowling lanes. Another is dimly lit, quiet, and has computers for virtual game play. Kids loved it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Brought my 3 children here on a Friday night. It is  loud so be prepared. \n",
      "We originally bought 2 cards with $20 on them. After 10 minutes I realized they would be out of money real quick SO I inquired on the food and play option ($15 for an hour with one food item or $22 for 2 hrs and one food item) . You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn't just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour\\/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect \"tickets\" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food. \n",
      "The \"prizes\" are ok. I like that you can save the card and continue to save the points.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kids love this place but allot of the games are not working.  Upgraded games\\/maintenance is desperately needed. Not sure if the old games are them trying to be Retro or cheap.  \n",

      "Pretty neat place. Arcade, bar, bowling, and even karaoke all in one. Only downside tons of children and teenagers everywhere. My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "While this is a more convenient location than the original Game Works it does somewhat lack the content and size of the strip location. I can't help but compare any venue of the type to Dave & Busters of which there is no comparison. We came for Birthday party, they did do a good job and our server Mike was outstanding. But $11 for six slices of pizza is a bit much as we had to buy over six pizzas to feed 10 hungry teens. Buy the size of the crowd its nice to see Game Works doing well but they could reduce the dinning area to accommodate more gaming space as it was only half full at best on a Saturday night. Overall we had good time.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games. \n",
      "\n",
      "Opening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet. \n",
      "Now, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~! \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!\n",

      "So always been fan of the concept of GameWorks since I visited one in Seattle years ago. The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar\\/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good. \n",
      "\n",
      "If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks.\n",

      "Last night we celebrated my husband's nephew's birthday here, per his request. The establishment is located in Town Square on the ground floor, right under the AMC Theater. There is ample parking in Town Square and the meters are used to collect donations, not to enforce parking fees, in short - your car won't get towed if you don't have change to spare. \n",

      "We arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn't get our water\\/beverages till after. I saw that he was rushing around and walking with a purpose (the dining area is kind of big). What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all. \n",
      "\n",
      "BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more \"prizes\" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered\\/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn't mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket. \n",

That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. \n",
      "\n",
      "They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Centipede\", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most \"little\" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play \"Call of Duty\" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by \"Barcade\" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, \"One Moscow Mule please\". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.\n",

      "Surprisingly, I didn't see OUT OF ORDER signs on any machines.  But the cost of playing kept my visit short.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gameworks seems too crowded. Every machine was Taken, so you practically have to fall in line for every game. We went on a Saturday afternoon\\/evening time. During the week it's probably much less busy so at least one game could be playable without having to wait. Had a done in and the service was quick and delicious. No problems with that.\n",
      "And I felt that there were too many racing games. Not enough 4 player games or FPS. Nice location, great atmosphere.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Guess this place just has a fun play around vibe. I'm comparing it to a place I used to go to that had games & food but was a hot spot to hang out at night! Took my 10 year old boy cousin and he had a LOT of fun!! From racing\\/shooting games to the ticket games! But the prizes were kinda ticketed too high for what my cousin could get on $20. Maybe kinda lower some of the prize ticket amounts an it would be good for the kids to want to come back. But this time around..was good! \n",
      "Went on a Thursday night. It was in the summer so it was very full with both kids and adults having fun. But my experience wasn't anything to brag about. I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were \"out of service\". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design. Very poor as a game fun center..didn't make it fun! Boo..bring a dave n busters!!!!!!!!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't give an all too extensive review because we were mostly secluded in the billiards area of the main bar (by the entry way). It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for \"The Color of Money\" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we'd have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an 'okay' experience for a limited one.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Being a gamer I had to check out this place. I've never been to the original GameWorks, but this place wasn't as bad as I had expected. My gf and I stopped by here to check out some of the old arcade and VR games. The prices are bit high for the games and drinks are pricey as well. Overall its a place to check out once.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!\n",

      "The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.\n",

      "There are way too many ticket machines which require no skill and attract little kids to use up all their quarters! I wish all the games gave tickets so they would actually play games besides ticket machines! A lot of machines were out of order. There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds. No matter how the adults feel, this is heaven for kids!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It is a play for kids, loud, games are worn down, toys are for kids. The food is not bad. I just wanted everyone to have some fun. My kids like it. Right out side there is this park is nice for them as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was the latest of several trips here with our 3 boys while visiting Vegas. Again it was great entertainment for the kids. However I was frustrated by the many machines that were not working at all or in desperate need of repair. I was recently at a Dave and Busters where the games were newer and in better shape. Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Honestly every time I go here the games are always broken and take my credits. It makes me sad. I also feel that the games take way too many credits to play especially for them to be broken. I always think \"hey lets go to gameworks\" and then I realize how bad it is everytime hahaha. Granted I hate chuck e cheese but it's way better as far as games go it also feels more liberating with actual tickets in your hand. I do prefer the people at gameworks VS chuck e cheese because it's flooded with little kids. Anyways Gameworks is ok... I guess lol\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great place for kid's parties. I recently attended one, where the family rented out a large room that had plenty of space for guests and tables full of pizza, wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and bruchetta. The food wasn't anything special, but that's to be expected from a place that focuses on games and entertainment. The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times.\n",

      "Games: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.\n",

      "Overall, not too bad but still feels like they are missing something.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great place for kids of all ages to play a wide variety of arcade games, ranging from high-end video games (sit inside of a capsule, with wrap-around screens) right down to those silly games you find at other venues that spit out paper tickets you can redeem for nearly worthless prizes.  Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I never tried the food at Gameworks, so I wrote a review about the games. The arcade is very fun for kids aged 3-8. I ended up wasting 20 bucks playing low quality and overrated games for little kids. I was more interested into the eSports games, which is near the back of Gameworks. eSports interests Pre-Teens and up. eSports has a Wii U for Smash Bros and Mario Kart 8, XBox for Mortal Kombat X and Minecraft, PS4 for Call of Duty or Counter Strike Global Offensive, and a computer that can download any playable game for free. It's very cheap for 1 hour, 5 bucks. I look forward to playing MK8 and SSB4.\n",

      "I still however love the environment. It reminds me more of a \"Dave and Buster's\" establishment with a bar and restaurant available right inside. You're able to reserve for parties which makes it perfect for groups and birthdays. If you're a hard core gamer this might not be the arcade for you since the selection of games is limited. But if your just here for fun family and games it'll be experience for you and whomever you want to bring. \n",

Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Onward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would really give Gameworks a 3.5 rating. They lose points for having expensive ass draft beers, poor service at the bar, and a limited section of games. All in all though, I would still return if I'm ever in the mood for it. I'll just get my drinks elsewhere!\n"

We opted for an hour unlimited play, which we understood that we wouldn't be getting tickets and about 12 machines that weren't valid with our pass. However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones. We still had fun with the ones that still worked, but I was pretty disappointed. They also have a bar here with reasonable prices along with a menu for food too.\n",

Their breakfast options are okay - wish the toast would be crispier. The service is better this time, at least our waitress did not get our drinks or our food orders wrong. Gneerally some of their staff needs to improve on their attitudes towards their customers. I get that it's a SUnday afternoon and you are busy, but there is no need to roll your eyes at your customers, especially when we as a large group already agreed to splitting up in order for her to seat us easier (yes i'm talking about the hostess). Anyway love the food, but they really need to work on their service... one of the rare occasions where i had to consider cutting my tip or no tip.\n",

I got the pan fried turnip cake. The congee was peas and sliced fish. It was ok, bit bland and watery. My husband got a bowl of soup rice vermicelli and an egg sandwich. He said his food was ok. The prices are cheap here and food is ok, not great, but you really can't expect much for the price you pay. They offer lots of dim sum choices too but why get frozen dim sum from here, when you can buy some from T & T and steam it yourself. \n",

The menu offers a variety of choices, from individual items to set meals for larger groups.  They also have lunch and dinner specials for a good price.

What a tease.  \n",

I was most excited for the fried rice, but it ended up being pretty bland and overall disappointing.  The curry was tasty, but I didn't have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent.  The other noodle dishes were good, but nothing amazing.  We ended off the meal with a dessert of green bean soup, which was quite tasty.\n",

If the fact that it's owned by the guy who owns Ming's (another popular HK cafe south of Pacific mall) doesn't peak your interest, then maybe the thousands of dollars of expensive iron man figures will? No? Well let's talk about the food: it's typical hk style level. I tried two breakfast specials for the sake of this review - luncheon meat instant noodles and corn beef egg sandwich with oatmeal. Both are average in taste and portions. But for $6 each what do you expect? Fast, efficient, service with economical typical dishes.

      "I've had a few things from their menu, and today I tried to Korean style pork chop cutlet with rice. The pork chop was fried really well, a nice light batter and not oily at all. I really enjoyed it. Came with a soup and tea. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pricing is on par with other HK style cafes, but you also get a free newspaper if you're into that. Lots of competition in the area, so I expect them to remain competitive and provide decent service.\n",

      "I came here with my family as they had advertised in the Chinese newspaper for some set Peking duck meals that includes soup and dessert. We wanted to try it out for lunch and had called ahead to make sure we're able to get that meal for lunch. They took a reservation for us and confirmed that we are able to do as we wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here for lunch on a Saturday of Chinese New Year and the restaurant was about 2\\/3 full, but they had ample staff there, I'm not sure if this is a normal thing or they had anticipated that it would be super busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We wanted to add a few more dishes and had asked for a server's suggestion, she suggested the best bang for our buck and ones that would be more suitable for my grandfather. We got a steamed lotus leaf fried rice with shrimp and I really enjoyed that one. The Hong Kong style milk tea was also great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Peking duck was ok, it wasn't as crispy as I have had it from other places. We were also served a whole fish, a soup, a seafood vegetable dish and noodle soup and they were also acceptable. At the end of our meal, we were waiting for our desserts, but we were told they only have dessert at dinner, but we had called about this meal and they said they're able to serve it at lunch and no where in the advertisement did it say dinner only. We were given some sort of kids' mango yoghurt dessert as a replacement, better than nothing I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am however, a bit confused as to what kind of restaurant to classify this, because my family had a 5-course Peking duck meal, something you usually get from a Chinese restaurant, but most of the menu, and the decor suggests a Hong Kong style cafe. Confusion aside, there's an array of items on the menu that will probably take you long to decide. Variety is the spice of life and if you're with a group of people who can't decide on one kind of food to eat, this would be great place to take them.\n"

      "It is all about market positioning.  In my opinion, when a restaurateur aims at a certain market, whether the restaurant is good depends on whether it delivers delicious food in a hygienic environment, and fulfils the expectation\\/norm of that market.  If it exceeds expectation, great, but IMO, \"good\" only requires meeting expectation.  Maybe my expectation of a HK cafe is not particularly demanding.  Maybe I have missed the poorly reviewed period of the grand opening.  During the first visit recently (in 2016), I find Kitchen M meeting expectation of a HK cafe..  The food is flavourful, the portion is satisfying, the pricing is on par with market, the value is sufficient, the ambiance is pleasant, the staff is efficient.  Kitchen M is great for lunch and a value dinner.  The food isn't so good that it could demand high prices, and Kitchen M doesn't charges high prices.  Here you go: it is A-OK.\n",

THere is only just enough sauce to prevent the pizza from being dry; lobster pieces are few and far between, tiny when you do come across 'em. Crust is salted, a little bit too much so, but a little salt did make eating pizza bones enjoyable.\n",

This most definitely is one of those all-beige-meals-that-is-pretty-tasty-but-you-know-you-shouldn't-be-eating. Polenta cakes were fried fingers of polenta and really satisfying on their own. bread was fresh. dip best enjoyed warm -- i.e. before it cools and congeals. Garnished on top were wo cherry tomatoes to trick you into thinking that the dish is remotely healthy.\n",

The salad was a little drenched in a pool of oil with some balsamic.  The Antipasti was good.  Tuscan burger was amazing. I thought the service was a little to be desired.  Reason being is that we had to ask for drink refills.  Also when I was looking to leave I had to take the bill up as our server was busy chatting it up with another table.  Maybe I'm just being picky but we were in a rush to leave!  For the price I expect a bit better service!\n",

The place felt very warm as we walk into the restaurant with the bar area on one side that is partition very well from the main the dining room.  With 8 of us, its always hard to find a place with a variety of dishes to choose from.  Fraticelli's definitely has a big selection of pasta, pizza, ravioli and steak.  Unfortunately my sister was looking forward to ordering the lobster ravioli as it was on the website but it was not available at this location (maybe not in season).\n",

      "\n",
      "The next awkward moment was when a different server came to ask us if everything was alright (as we were about to leave through the front doors) because we didn't leave a tip.  Since we used a particular coupon, it stated gratuity would be included in the final amount, and it was 18%.  We had to point out the gratuity amount on the bill was charged already and then we left.  This might've rubbed some people the wrong way.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Mains we had their Fiorentina pizza which came with a shareable caesar salad.  We both came to an agreement the pizza was good, but not overly impressive, as the distribution of ingredients on the pizza was off. The salad was good, just wished they put more cheese...again its a personal thing. Overall rating for this dish was approximately 3\\/5\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is the 3rd  version of the Springs Cafe that I know of, and its still about the same.  To be honest, the location and the view get the 4 stars, the food probably warrants about 3.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dining choices are good, and I've never had bad food or bad service, but there is nothing terribly special about the offerings. A solid burger, good wraps, good pizzas, some interesting specials. Again, the food takes second place to the location.\n",

      "Another quality Happy Hour location in Vegas that I somehow came across. Only on Thursdays, from 4:00-8:00, they offer some great drink specials including $4 beers and $6 wines. The food isn't anything more than pub fare but it gets the job done. Live music and great views make for a nice evening. And the crowd was pretty small so you had the pick of the tables for sure. Definitely worth a trip on HH Thursdays. A nice change from your typical pub early evening out and a great way to begin Thirsty Thursday.\n",

      "We're pretty pleased w\\/ Divine Cafe.  We've been coming out for lunch fairly regularly after spending the day at Spring's Preserve with our toddler son.  Lately I've been hooked on their  Angus burger, its loaded w\\/ your choice of cheese, 2 thick slices of bacon along w\\/ lettuce & tomato.  Its pretty filling plus all their sandwiches come w\\/ french fries, sweet potato tots or chips.  My hubby likes their turkey wrap and my son loves their kid's cheese pizza, it comes out piping hot so be careful w\\/ your lil ones.  Our total this afternoon, w\\/ our 10% member discount came to ~$27 including 2 Honest Teas and a kids drink, which comes w\\/ the kid's meal.  For fast casual the food is pretty darn good and priced very reasonably.\n",

      "Most of us have gone to a theme park and been greatly disappointed by the food services.  Usually prepackaged, microwaved fare or fast food level, or super pricey)   Even the great San Diego Zoo has mediocre food for the most part (although if you search they do have some gems).  So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the Springs Cafe which offers well prepared, gourmet style lunches and entrees at reasonable prices.  I had a ceviche salad that was excellent.  The hamburgers were great and the sides excellent.  The sundays were tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't a gourmet location though and the service is underwhelming, the ambiance mediocre. In fact the service was very poor, they tried to bring our deserts (we got free sundays with the coupon on the flyer) at the same time as the meal. Then when we got them to understand we wanted them to wait on delivery, they got mixed up as to how many we ordered.  Also the food takes a while.  But the food is worth it and even the picky eaters I was with enjoyed their meal without complaints, not an easy task.\n"

This was delicate, cooked perfectly and had amazing smokey flavor.  It honestly was just perfect.  The view from the deck overlooking LasVegas was the final touch.  I will be back in a few weeks for work and will becoming by here for a nice lunch.  \n",

When we requested hot sauce our waiter brought two different kinds, then brought a grilled jalapeno pepper to boot! The manager stopped by to ask about our experience.

I really expected bigger, but overall the taste quality wise was good. My wrap was delicious with a hint of spice and red peppers. + fries. We sat on the balcony & ate & it was a nice experience. I will be back. =)\n",

We ordered the Monte Cristo, Portallo mushroom panini with a side of broccoli cheddar soup, and the BBQ chicken salad. The spin on the Monte Cristo resembled a breakfast French toast with ham. Very good. The panini has a nice helping of provolone for the cheese lovers! That, with the mushroom and grilled zucchini and bell peppers... nom, nom, so good! Also, has outside seating overlooking the springs and a strip view.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here is tasty and well prepared, a relief with kids in tow.  Just not that many items on their menu.  I say this because I expect overpriced pre-packaged food from museum cafes.  However, it seems to be very well run with a manager who oversees the preparation of the food.  The menu is simple and the staff very friendly.  I love the view from this location of the preserves, as well as, the Strip, most specifically you can see the Stratosphere.  I forget I'm in Vegas!  For what you get, the food is great. Don't hesitate coming here if you're visiting the Spring Preserves.  Of course the prices will be inflated but they're not outrageous.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yelpers, you should bookmark this place.  The Divine Cafe only has one happy hour and it's on Thursdays from 4-8PM.  The restaurant is separate from the Preserve so you don't need a museum or parking ticket.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The cafe\\/venue itself deserves 5 stars all on its own because it is very large and can accommodate large parties, families, or intimate dates inside OR outside.  Outdoor seating would be my preference because it provides a panoramic view of Las Vegas.  You can see downtown as well as the Strip.  However, the indoors gives off a rustic vibe with doors and windows that still have access to that beautiful view.  There's also live music inside which, in my opinion, is uncommon in this city.  For all those reasons, this place is worth a visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their happy hour menu is very limited, but has just enough variety.  They have their own cocktail drinks, a nice selection of bottled beers, and wine.  I was most impressed by the food portions.  We ordered nachos, calamari, and the date flatbread.  I thought they would be tapas style, and boy was I wrong.  The portions were very generous, and for the price, they're almost a steal considering the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Food was great, but my favorite was the bacon and date flatbread.\n",

      "I haven't been here in a couple years since it was Wolfgang Puck's restaurant and even though it was good, it was pricey for what I wanted. I noticed this time around, it changed names and it took some convincing from my hungry boyfriend to just eat here while on our Springs Preserve date than venture off campus. That being said:\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the chicken pesto pizza $10 and a burger (boyfriend never mentioned the name) $9-10 ordered medium rare. The views are beautiful and so relaxing with their floor to ceiling windows overlooking Springs Preserve and the Vegas skyline from the northwestern perspective. Food didn't take long and they brought it to the table. My pizza was definitely not just a personal size. It's good enough for two super hungry people or three people snacking. DELICIOUS. The oils from the cheese were everywhere and when you pull the slice, it had that glorious stretch of soft fresh cheese...the way pizza was meant to be. Johnny's burger was pretty good, better than I would expect. It looked like a gourmet burger with a half pound or so patty cooked medium rare with its juices still intact on a brioche bun. All the condiments you need are already on the table including hot sauces. Oh, and the fountain drinks include a dispenser of water infused with mint and sliced strawberries. With  a squeeze of lemon, it was amazingly refreshing and tasteful for the hot summer day.\n",

      "The outdoor seating area does have heaters when it is chilly. Happy hour is on Thursdays 4pm to 8pm. They sometimes have classes on how to cook too.\n",

      "We've been visiting the park for almost a year but it is our 1st time here. I'm between 4 and 5 star rating and heres my review:\n",
      "\n",
      "Food - we ordered Chicken Milanese, Teriyaki Salmon bowl & rootbeer float with oreo churros - generous portions and were all yummy. They have fruit infused water for all which was great. We're looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Its good to have options beyond the usual burger and hotdog when you are at a park\\/museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Price - reasonable though everything is $10+. Reasonable becoz portions are generous and bcoz prices at themeparks and the like are usually pricier. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance - dine inside or outside. The patio has good view of the mountains and of the Las Vegas hotel bldgs. The patio provides enough shade. We dined in September so it was comfortable outside I just dont know how it is in the middle of hot hot Vegas summer =) The whole place is generally clean and well kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service - there seems to be adequate staff... but the food was served longer than expected. But we didn't really mind as we were enjoying the birds while we sat at the patio. All staff from the cashier to the server and table guy we're all very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We will definitely be back to try out other items from their menu and dine at their patio =)\n",

      "One of the best museum Cafes around! My family and I really enjoy having lunch here after our regular visit to the Springs Preserve grounds & museums. I think they offer a nice variety of great food at fair prices. So far, I really haven't had anything Ive disliked. Have tried the burger, wedge salad with chicken, Cuban sandwich, chicken sandwich & Hawaiian teriyaki bowl. All good, fresh food & good portions. I have brought a few friends here who hadn't eaten at the cafe before & they were all pleasantly surprised. When the weather gets nice outside (spring & fall), we really like sitting outside & having lunch while enjoying the amazing views. Highly recommend checking it out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had the brisket and also the vegan sandwiches. One with side salad and the other with fries. Both entrées were really good and the side salad with house dressing was surprisingly good. Also ordered the kids mac and cheese and appreciated how they had fruit and vegetables as sides. I'd get the vegan burger again. \n",
      "\n",
      "We received a membership discount so we were pleasantly surprised by our bill! I didn't give 5 stars because I would like to try another item on menu the next time we are here.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been up here about 5 times now and the latest was when Springs Preserve held their Space exhibit.  What's not to love about this place.  The food quality has always been good, you can sit outside for a good view of Springs Preserve with your meal and their menu is simple.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't come here if you're looking for a fancy place with a good view.  The menu literally consists of only salads, burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas.  Oh they do serve alcohol though!  \n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing I got here were the lobster rolls which was yummy.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised with the food here.  I had the tasty chicken BLT and my husband had the Cuban sandwich, which was savory.  The bread on the Cuban was a bit dry but the overall taste made up for it. We also ordered the kids chicken fingers combo, which came with fruit, carrots\\/celery, tater tots and gold fish crackers.. One of the healthier kids combos we've seen in a while. Our kid loved it.  I had a glass of their Chardonnay, which was fruity and crisp. My husband had their Lager on draft.. Refreshing\n",

      "The Good:\n",
      "great tasting food\n",

      "reasonable prices\n",
      "peaceful setting with great views, especially outside\n",

      "The bad:\n",
      "Try to avoid during kids field trip lunches for obvious reasons\n",
      "they closed!  looking forward to the new opening...I hope they maintain the high quality and reasonable pricing.\n",
      "the last few days they were open prior to shutting down was disgraceful...they really phoned it in.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here the other day with my two kids. My son ordered a quesadilla as usual and actually ate the whole thing- which he never does! It looked really good and came with a fruit skewer. I had the Mexican bento box. The meat was delicious but everything else was eh. I liked it enough to come back. Great food for kids I think.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great menu, delicious food and an amazing view of the city. Definitely an unexpected treat at a museum and botanical garden. Great kids menu too.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My friend and I were recently at the Springs Preserve for the Vegas Gone Yoga festival and we decided to check out this cafe while on a lunch break. I liked that they had a variety of different vegetarian friendly options and the outdoor seating area was beautiful. When you walk in you place your order at the counter and they bring it out once it's ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "For food I decided to go with the garden sliders and a side salad. The sliders were not really a veggie patty, but more of a veggie mush. I wish they would have been more patty like, but overall the flavor was still good. (3.5\\/5) The salad was also a nice touch, very fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely a nice option for a lunch break at the park with some beautiful scenery.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went to this place yesterday and was served a buffalo chicken and blue cheese salad. My husband got a bbq brisket sandwich on a pretzel bun with fries. Or food was good, but it wasn't too hot temperature wise. Additionally the brisket sandwich was sliced brisket, so it didn't really blend with the sauce well. Because of this, my husband didn't really easy much of it. We enjoyed the food though, the service was fast and polite. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Every year I have a tradition of hiking the trails of the Springs Preserve when ghosts, goblins, wicked pumpkins, and other haunted creatures adorn the park. I never got to experience the nightime Haunted Harvest. Knowing that I was going to be in the park all day, I decided to have lunch in the park's Divine Cafe. \n",
      "\n",
      "   My expectations of theme park \\/cultural center food is convenience over quality. However, Divine Cafe exceeded my expectations. It wasn't really a shock because I had been there before to enjoy a beverage. The restaurant did have a positive vibe. Heidi Knapp Rinella in her September 25, 2014 Review Journal article \"Springs Preserve's Divine Cafe True to its Name\" says it best:\n",
      "\n",
      "       \"The Springs Preserve doesn't have to have\n",
      "        a cafe. But, like the preserve, it sure makes\n",
      "        life a lot nicer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  As soon as you exit the elevator or climb the steps above the gift shop, you enter a divine space. Your eyes immediately overlook the counter and football field of tables, chairs, and even sofas toward the glass walls with one of the most divine views in Las Vegas. This is a divine vista including a panorama of the Downtown Las Vegas skyline with the Stratosphere and Las Vegas Strip skyline framing the open spaces of dessert and wetlands. When it comes to eating with a view, Divine Cafe is a jackpot. The two places to enjoy the view are from inside and the patio. The inside is like a glass house where many tables are front row.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ordering is relatively easy. There are menus outside and at the entrance. I ordered the burger with fries and a fountain beverage. After a Yelp check-in offer for a free beverage with an entree it came to less than $11. The burger was made of the finest ingredients. This was a thick burger with tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and provolone cheese. The fries were plentiful and flavorful. The bottomless cola was refreshing. The condiments on the table made dining a better experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "  I was impressed with the service. Immediately the friendly lady greeted me when I walked inside. When I asked if the burger included cheese, she mentioned the four choices the menu omitted. She happily accepted my Yelp check in offer. Minutes after I put my number on the table, a friendly man brought my food to the table. He also cleaned up the plate. Another aspect of good customer service is confidence that no funny stuff is going on with my food. Divine Cafe has an open kitchen where I could see my food being made. Likewise, I know that it is being freshly made. On another note, Divine Cafe is especially clean. To my olfactory scent, the bathroom smelled more like the scented air in the Aria than a public restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Just like Springs Preserves, Divine Cafe provides a terrific experience at a great price. I was very impressed. Hopefully one day I could make their Thursday Happy Hour and take in the sun going down over the panoramic vista of Downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe I'll return for their new weekend brunch. Until then, I will reward Divine Cafe with a review of four stars that says \"I'm impressed! \n"

      "Lots of parking, but may be crowded on some days.  No need to pay the park entrance fee to eat at the cafe.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Wonderful view of the city and the park.  Inside and outside dining.  The food is pretty good.  Employees are friendly.  The manager dropped by to check on things and say hello.  Prices are a little high, but not bad.  Daily specials are served in a bento box.  The menu is designed with sustainability in mind.  Busy lunch crowd.  My favorite part of this experience is the atmosphere.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We really enjoyed our lunch here. I'm between four and 5 stars. Its located in the springs preserve. On the second story with a lovely view of the strip. Tons of greenery around us. Their is an indoor and outdoor section (with heaters for the winter, and it's covered for summer shade).\n",
      "\n",
      "During happy hour Thursday's 4-8pm it's 5 stars. Right now probably 4 stars because the coffee tasted pretty trashy, and expensive for lacking in flavor brew ($3).\n",
      "  \n",
      "The food is surprisingly good. We had the pizza Blanca ($9.5): it had truffle oil, arugula, white sauce and mushrooms. Nice crust, good flavor. They have several decent craft brews available. We had a Samuel adams ($5-6)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was quite impressed with the cafe. I always assume food vendors and restaurants inside of museums or government buildings are more of a convenience than an actual attraction however the Divine Cafe has me waiting for next weekend to return. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love Veggie Benedict's so I gave theirs a try and to my surprise the ingredients were fresh and the presentation was impressive. The views of the valley are also worth trying the Cafe. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would have given them a 5 star review but the only reason I couldn't was because they cooked the spinach on the Veggie Benny instead of using fresh spinach leaves. This is more of a preference of mine vs an actual knock on the cafe. The rest of the menu was diverse and had many great, light summer type meals. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the menu was well thought out since most customers will be continuing their exploration of the park therefore need a light meal to avoid feeling sluggish. I enjoyde the cafe very much and can't wait to go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A snacking jewel in the Preserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent food and a surprisingly gorgeous view of the Strip is the main draw of the Divine Springs Cafe. I came here on Thursday for the Happy Hour special which is from 4pm to 8pm and offers bar food and a decent selection of beers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I went with the tater tots, that were free with a donated toy to \"Toys for Tots\", and the Chicken Nachos. I also sampled the house chips that we're placed on the table as soon as  sat down. This place is by no means a hot bed of foodie activity, but a more a refueling station after exploing the preserve.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food is on par with most bar bites, nothing was terrible, but it also wasn't mindblowing, it was just good. The Nachos are a huge portion and definitely shareable and the house chips were nice salty snack before we were inundated with salty carby treats. \n",
      "\n",
      "They only offer Happy Hour on Thursdays and the menu is pretty limited, but it's perfect food for socializing and catching up with the homies. I would recommend coming here during the day, this way you'll have a chance to snack on their full menu. \n",
      "\n",
      "Learn stuff and eat. It's the American way!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "New name and menu and improved food.  Checked our the restaurant at the Springs Preserve for the first time since the latest update.  I've eaten at the cafe 5-7 times over the years including when it was Wolfgang Puck and after as well.  I think this update is an improvement in both price and taste. We had 3 entrees and 3 kids meals for $44. My kids are 3,5,6 and the kids meals were a good amount of food for them asks included fresh fruit \\/ veggies. The kids mac n cheese is yummy and the snack tray was perfect for my 3year old. The lobster sandwich special was awesome with the tomato bisque soup especially for $10. The service was more attentive than in the past although I've never had an issue on previous visits they just seemed a little more helpful this time. In the past the foods quality was hit or miss and a little overpriced. As a member that meant we normally skipped the café.  With this update we will definitely stop more often on our visits.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Next time you're bored on a Thursday, come to Springs Preserve for a quick trail run... then swing into the Divine Cafe for Happy Hour from 4-8PM! Or just do the HH, I won't tell anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that a museum\\/park restaurant has decent food is already a delightful surprise, but throw in a liquor license and happy hour and you've actually got something pretty unique. HH features live jazz and a limited menu of appetizers and seasonal cocktails, not to mention the phenomenal view.\n",
      "\n",
      "KETTLE CHIPS: Brought to the table upon seating, decently fresh and nicely seasoned. Provided ranch for dipping? A fresh salsa would be way better!\n",
      "DEVILED EGGS: four egg halves topped with kalamata olives, simple but tasty, with a low $4 price tag.\n",
      "CHEESEBURGER SLIDERS: Nice chargrilled taste, thick patties, topped with lettuce, tomato, and burger sauce.\n",
      "ARTICHOKE AND CHICKEN NAAN: The highlight of our mini-meal! Served like a sandwich, think of a Panini made of naan, filled with cheese, artichoke, a bit of spinach, and strips of grilled chicken. This would make a good lunch option, generous portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to all that tasty food, the service changes from walk-up to table service when they transition to HH. The young ladies who attended to us were super friendly and genuine. Looking forward to coming back!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I almost hate to write to this review because sometimes you want to keep a great secret all to yourself. That's what I feel the Divine Café is - it's a place that not many people know about which is a shame because it's such a great place. It's a very open, casual place where the mix of customers seem to all be enjoying their meals. We go to the Divine Café every Saturday unless something comes up or I'm out of town and it seems like I always have the burger with cheddar cheese. These burgers are huge and come with either salad, fries, or their homemade chips. They are topped with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a really great pepper mayonnaise.  I've had great burgers here in Vegas, but for me all those other burgers don't compare to the burger here. This is the place with the best burgers. I always take the family so I've \"tasted\" other items from their menu and have to say that I have enjoyed everything I've tasted there. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Divine Café is located at the Springs Preserve so after eating we walk the trails or see the exhibits they have to offer. As members we get ten percent off our meal. The staff is always friendly - from the person taking our order to the person who brings the food to the table. It's a great place. The café has a great outdoor seating area that gives you a great view of the city. We love to sit outside and enjoy good company, good atmosphere, and good food.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I have out of town guests come to visit you know that before they leave Vegas they are going to the Divine Café.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food is delicious, waiting for the food took a while but it was during the superhero day so it was pretty busy. I wanna come here during Sunday brunch!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been meaning to check out this cafe (and the Springs Preserve) for awhile, and am happy to say it's definitely a place I'll be keeping on my \"go to\" list.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you don't need to be a member of Springs Preserve to go to the Divine Cafe, although I would highly recommend making a pleasant day\\/afternoon of it and seeing the Preserve, along with the Nevada State Museum which is also there on the grounds.   It's extremely interesting, educational and also great if you have out of town relatives or friends who are bored with the same old same old hotels, bars, Strip stuff.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Divine Cafe is wonderful to get away from  the noise, congestion and tourists - that's why so many locals have found it and enjoy going there for a bite.  It's located on the second floor near the Origen building.  You can take the elevator or stairs to get there.  It's a very open, clean and attractive space with indoor and outdoor patio seating.  If you sit on the patio\\/deck as I did, you can get a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding area, the Preserves, and off in the distance, the Strip. On a lovely day with cooler weather, it's certainly one of the more pleasant destinations around!\n",
      "\n",
      "You order your food from a nicely varied menu that serves up food every bit as good as any restaurant in town. As others have pointed out, this is not some cheapo snack bar with crappy burgers and hot dogs.  This is quality food.   When you place your order, they give you a cute little table holder with your order number.  You can sit anywhere you like, indoor or outside.    Yes, the prices are a bit on the high side, thus my four stars, however, it may be worth it to you for the location and quality.  I had the Angus burger ($9.50) and it was very good.  High quality beef, bacon strips, arugula leaves instead of the usual lettuce....I was very pleased! I ordered it \"well done\" and guess what?  It was cooked PERFECTLY!  None of that icky red beef that seems to be the \"in\" thing for burgers these days.  And the meat patty was still wonderfully juicy and had that top sirloin flavor that you'd expect from high quality beef. The bacon strips were also perfect - neither too thick nor too thin, crunchy yet not chewy as is often found on burgers today.  It  came with fries which were nicely seasoned, crisp, and flavorful.    \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the burger, I had the hazelnut beignets which came with TWO yummy dipping sauces - raspberry and caramel.  Price:  $6.00.  Again, a bit pricey but there was enough for two, so it was definitely splittable.  Total:  a bit over $16.00.  But hey, this is sort of a unique place, in the Preserves, with a view, so I guess you'd have to say you're paying for the ambiance.  The food is very good and is really  better than other places I've been, both on and off the Strip.  Bottom line, I'd for sure go back and would be happy to bring out of town visitors here for an enjoyable day of browsing the Spring Preserves and then topping it off with a lovely lunch\\/brunch on the patio looking out at the view. You can also order beer and wine, although I didn't check that out.  I can see how it would be really nice to sit with a drink for awhile there.   Servers and staff were friendly helpful and very professional.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Divine Cafe opens at 11am (weekdays), 10am on weekends (brunch),  and closes  at 3pm, so be sure to time your Preserves browsing to end  back at Divine Cafe around 1:00 or so, you don't want to feel rushed to eat and leave by 3pm.   Thanks Divine Cafe, for a very enjoyable meal!  Looking forward to doing brunch next time and having  the french toast! I'm sure it's fab!\n"

      "I had a bite of the lotsa mozza salad. It was good. It didn't look like a traditional salad. It was on a polenta cake that tasted like cornbread and had marinara and arugula on top. It was quite good. I would recommend trying it. \n",

It is near my work so every now and then I come over and dine here. I really enjoy their fresh, creative salads, the flatbreads are tasty and just last week I tried the special being tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. The service is good and looking out over the Springs Preserve into the city is absolutely beautiful not to mention relaxing. I love that they have a happy hour on Thursdays where one can come have a drink and listen to some music before heading home. As we all know driving up the 95 kinda stinks at the old 5:00 hour. They also offer creative cooking classes which I have yet to try as I am not Giada but maybe I will get around to it someday. This is a great kick back spot and we need to support this place.

      "There aren't many restaurants more \"under the radar\" than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve. It's out of the way for most tourists visiting the Strip or Downtown and it's a destination most locals don't think of when looking for a meal, unless you're also visiting the exhibits at Springs Preserve. With a kitchen led by Steve Piamchuntar (former chef and owner of Nosh & Swig) they're serving up some surprisingly good dishes for lunch and brunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chef Steve has brought his refined skills and whimsical and modern touch to this cafe. With their recently changed menu they're offering a diverse menu with plenty for adults and kids, alike. Standard American fare like caesar salads, burgers, and pizzas are available. While the burger ($9.50) was decent, non-typical dishes make this place shine compared to other cafes in town. Singapore chicken cups ($9.50) are lettuce wraps with balanced sweetness and savoriness. The pressed chicken milanese ($11) is a must. It eats like a sandwich but has flavors that are fitting for any larger meal. For brunch the pan dulce french toast ($8) was great. More like a creamy bread pudding with bread soaked through with custard, it's perfect for those wanting to satisfy their sweet tooth early in the day. And, to polish off a meal try the root beer float ($6). It's accompanied by an Oreo dusted churro that's as good as any you'll find in town.\n",

      "The vegan burger is my favorite thing on the menu and I'm a meat eater. It's surprisingly good. No wait, I lied. The Monte Cristo sandwich is the best thing that has ever been on the menu. Unfortunately it is no longer being sold.\n",
      "Also, the Springs Cafe is astonishingly better than the Wolfgang Puck crapshack it has replaced. There's just no comparison.\n",

      "Great lunch spot with a diverse selection, can't beat the views and the environment of the springs preserve itself. I want to come back and try their happy hour or brunch, too, when I have more time! The only downside is each time I've been in there's only been a few people in line to order at the counter, usually only one person taking the orders, and it's been very slow. The last time it took over 20 mins to get through the three of us in line, and that's half the time I have for my lunch. Other than that, the experience and food were great!\n",

      "I had the spinach salad with the beef, for $12 they need to throw on more spinach and less red onions, overall the salad was good.  My husband enjoyed his fish tacos and my kids could have split a kids meal, the pbj and grilled cheese sandwiches were huge and the fruit bowl that comes with the kids meal is huge too .. all for $4 per kids meal (sandwich, fruit and milk).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A very nice cafe on the grounds of the Spring Preserve. The Hawaiian pizza was really good, but I think it's bigger than they advertise. Not really a problem, but keep that in mind that two people could easily share a small personal pizza.\n",

      "Great view of Vegas from the restaurant and the balcony.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent food in a relaxing atmosphere. I had a bowl of the pork fajita soup and enjoyed the rich stock, black beans, tomatoes, chunks of pork, and tortilla strips. The ice tea is flavorful. They deliver the food to your table and check on you midway through eating. I will return whenever I can.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have to say, with the change away from Wolfgang Puck's name - it's a welcome change. I was getting tired of seeing the same things on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been here several times since the new change - and I have to admit, I like the new changes they have come up with. There are a few staples, but they also incorporate a lot of new dishes, and that has got my taste buds singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last time I came out here I had the Bento Box, my daughter the grill cheese, and the other couple I was with shared a burger meal. I loved the Bento Box - a little greasy for the egg roll, but everything else was just right!\n",
      "\n",
      "The specials are swapped out more frequently - and that is a good change to see! It's nice to see fresh ideas moving in, and get the future generations touch of good meals! You can definitely see the urge to please from the employees as you wait for your food. They show genuine concern for your happiness during your meal, and if things are delayed they are genuinely apologetic about it all! \n",
      "\n",
      "Might as well check out the rest of the preserves while you are there! (Or if you are there first, then might as well eat here!)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After a couple of hours touring the Springs Preserve I was feeling a bit hungry and thirsty.  I was also kind of hot as late May in Las Vegas is starting to warm up.  To complete my experience I thought I would give Divine Cafe a try.  It did not disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a burger because I was hungry.  I ordered an iced tea because I was thirsty.  I ordered a salad because I was hot.  It did not take long for my burger to come out.  And it came out perfect.  I asked for medium and that is exactly what I got.  It was still pink in the center and taste like quality fresh beef.  I had juice dripping down to my elbow so you know it wasn't dry.  The toppings were good too.  A nice thick slice of tomato, greens, super crisp bacon.  It was a fantastic burger.  The salad was pretty good too.  I like the greens they used.  And the cucumber slices were a nice touch.  I would have been upset about not having my choice of dressing but it was exactly what I would have ordered anyway.  A delicious vinaigrette.  The one complaint I had about the salad was the 8 inch long stripps of carrot that looked like orange noodles.  They were kind of hard to eat as they were too thin to be picked up by fork the way everything else was.  Other than that, no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was fortunate that the staff at the order window saw I had left my bag from the gift shop at the counter.  I had a couple of things in there I did not want to leave without.  Like my ball cap and sunglasses.  I was worried when I could not find my bag but then I noticed they had pushed it aside and were waiting for me to collect.  Goodonya, Divine Cafe.\n"

      "Okay, so first of all, my ahi salad was very, very good. Also, cucumber water is always a treat. And, the view is spectacular; one of the best in the city. Now that's out of the way...can we talk price vs portion? My salad was delicious, but for a $10+ salad, I'd appreciate a larger helping. I'm not even asking for more Ahi; there was plenty of that; buy dump on the greens, I can take it. Also, and this was purely circumstantial, though I can imagine it happening often: people's children. Christ on a cracker, can you please control your little zoo animals? Letting your children run, play, roll around on the floor, and use adjoining empty tables as their own jungle gyms is not only rude to other patrons, it demonstrates a significant deficiency in parental ability. To the restaurant: please discourage this kind of obnoxious behavior. I absolutely love the Preserve, but hesitate to bring my friends with me to Divine Cafe, lest we get caught up in some variant Lord of the Flies scenario. Otherwise, thanks for the fresh lunch and the relaxing, refrigerated view on a sunny day.\n",

Salads, veggies and whatnot, the salad my man ordered was amazing he loved it, fresh crispy iceberg wedge.  I got the Caesar, yummy.  We also got the CHARCUTERIE a nice basic variety of tasty Cheese and Meats but good.  We finished off with a TURKEY WRAP it was so good, I was so full but ate more then I wanted.  \n",

      "This past weekend, my bf and I did a quick trip to Champaign, because we just needed to get out of Chicago for a couple of days.  When we parked our car and walked down Green St., there were a whole bunch of NEW restaurants compared to when I went to college years ago.  One familiar restaurant was Zorba's.  Got two med. gyros, fries, and drinks to go.  When we sat outside on the quad, we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro.  So eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all!  Really good and the pita seemed fresh and light, not super greasy like the joints here in Chicago.  Don't think I'll go back to Champaign for a long time, but it's a great lunch\\/dinner option.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mmmm... gyro.  I know that Zorba's isn't authentic Greek food-- I go to Chicago for that, but for what it is, it's excellent.  The service is always very friendly and speedy, and they have a fairly large menu and is inexpensive.  They also have Killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection.  Zorba's is probably my favorite green street eatery.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came to Zorba's on the suggestion by a cousin who has, and I quote, \"never given a bad food recommendation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was another hit!  Chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At other Greek spots, I'm used to having a humongous foil wrapped hunk of a mess of gyro served to me that I inevitably finish... and end up feeling like a blob because I didn't want to waste food.  But Zorba's is here to help you with portion control!  I like how they offer their gyros in 4 different sizes.  Oh, and try the cucumber sauce.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You know you're in for a treat when it takes 9.8 seconds for the grease in your meal to seep through the bottom of the paper bag.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place was delicious!\n",
      "My roommate and I came here on default because the other place we were trying to go to was already closed!\n",
      "But good thing the gyros & fries here were delicious and made-to-order!  And the gyro meat tasted super fresh!  I loved how you can get extra cucumber sauce and the \"hot sauce\" obviously was mixed with the cucumber sauce...all delicious!\n",
      "The establishment has been open for awhile and I can see why college students would come here after partying!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "ok, so I went to Zorbas today. first time I've been there since the fire. I'll start 9ff buy saying the food tasted great as expected.\n",
      "that being said I noticed a few things that concerned me. \n",
      "1. no longer is there the choice of beef, chicken or lamb. the choices are chicken and a beef\\/lamb mix. \n",
      "2. the meat is no longer sliced to order but sliced ahead of time and kept in a steam table. it tastes better when sliced to order and heated on the griddle.\n",
      "3. the Baklava was really tough almost impossible to cut.\n",
      "remember, I DID say the food still tasted great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been here multiple times and it is truly the best place for food on Green Street. I have gone with the gyros both times and have not been disappointed. The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. On top of it, the atmosphere gives you a feel to what our culture at U of I is like. Pass up the chains and go to Zorba's. Take it from an ILLINI - you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Cool place for lunch on campus... It's right next door to Za's, where I've going a bit too often, so I'm glad I finally gave it a try. They're specialty is gyros sandwiches (on pita bread): pick your meat (lamb or chicken), size (small, medium, large), and sides (get the combo which comes with fries and a drink). I tried the chicken, and it was good, although I wish the meat had been a little more grilled (it wasn't crispy at all). Their fries are great! They also have a few other things on the menu (regular sandwiches etc), and they're open late most nights. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Loved the Greek salad and gyro plate. This is a staple in  campus town for good reason. The inside displays classic Illini newspaper clippings, and the staff is kind and welcoming. Check them out if you're in the mood for a gyro.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The gyros were pretty good, but their fries came with this amazing sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a delish combination of honey mustard but smelled and tasted like there was bacon in it.  I'm not sure what exactly it was but we couldn't stop dipping our fries in it - so good!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great gyros and fries. Often crowded, so plan on a wait for food and a table.  Go on Tuesdays for discount prices.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is fantastic. Everything from their gyros to hummus to fries are all on point. Live jazz is great (I forget which nights) and their special deal on Tuesdays makes this a great lunch spot on Green Street. This place definitely exceeds expectations in Chambana, and I hope it continues to thrive!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hands down the most underrated place on campus. Everything they offer is at least good, while their gyros are nothing short of amazing (for Chambana, at least). The jazz shows are a nice touch, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always friendly. One of my favorite places to spend a break, whether it's between classes or during work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five-star rating, but it deserves a strong four.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt and his gang do a great job. Love the chicken Gyros.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "so greasy it burned the fuck down ! i am sure each gyro and basket of fries i ate there each knocked 6 months off of my lifespan. All I can say is I;m still alive so I obviously didn't eat there enough\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tender gyros meat at decent prices. Just stick with a gyros sandwich (the fries are mediocre). This place has been around since my parents were on UIUC's campus in the early-mid 70s and it's a great place to take them. I can't speak to the seating during peak hours because I usually would drop by here if there was a deal on Hooked midafternoon if I hadn't eaten lunch.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The classic chicken gyro is one of the simplest and best gyros I have ever eaten though the taste could have been more exotic. The Hooked deal of getting a meal in the cost of a gyro for take out is quite cheap and worth the price. Also I would recommend fish lovers to visit on Friday as they have some amazing deals and fish  dishes on friday.\n"

      "\n",
      "Zorbas was a staple during undergrad and it hasn't lost its taste in the years since I've left.  Regardless of where I move or visit, every gyro I have is compared to Zorbas - they're the gold standard in my mind.  The meat is always juicey and the fries always salty.  Perfect for a social lunch or a recovery meal.  \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good good fast! Pricing was reasonable. I was a bit taken aback by my hummus and pita arriving as a sandwich instead of separate. The bread was great, the hummus was just average. I really liked my gyro though!\n",

I'm pretty indecisive so I would prefer a menu that wasn't taped to the counter where you order. Being able to peruse a bit would have been nice. Even so, I ordered a falafel with feta and jalapenos and it was fantastic. Even the fries were delicious and I'm just not a potato fan. The biggest pro - They have a tzatziki dispenser! Most places charge you for extra and considering condiments are the highlight of my meal, this was fantastic! I also thought the gyros were delicious although it is tough to mess that up I think. The price is great, you can eat here for just about $5.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Gyros, tzatziki, fries, and friendly cooks and cashiers make this place a must-go.  My parents graduated from the U of I in 1981, and Zorba's was there back then!  Considering the relatively high turnover rate of Campustown restaurants, I think that's pretty impressive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A Champaign Institution, great gyros, with even better service.  Definitely a can't miss when you are on Illinois' campus.  Check their daily specials before you go in some of them are great.  The fact that you can order a small, medium. or large gyro and customize it however you want make it good for any size appetite.\n",

      "Yep, it lived up to the hype. Great gyro sandwiches with a cool local feel. The pita is soft and the gyro meat is some of the most tender I've found. Brilliantly seasoned too, the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart. I also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches. \n",

      "I absolultely LOVE gyros so this is a no-brainer for me. I feel like this place is a staple of quick, delicious campus food. It's pretty much a total hole in the wall, but it's totally Illini, everything about the decor just screams it. Not to mention the gyros are bomb. Go if you haven't already!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "good ole z-bots as we liked to call this one back in the day.  yes, this place is an institution...been around since green and wright was just spaceport, garcias, and mcdonalds.  hasnt changed much cept that now i can drink the beer.  wonder if they will still accept my stamp card from way back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't believe I walked past this place for three years.  What is more sad is that many of those times were likely while I walked into Subway across the street on a Tuesday afternoon to drop $5 on a Veggie Delight.  Little did I know I could get a delicious, warm, and fresh vegetable hummus pita across the street for a little over a dollar.  At least I have many more Tuesdays ahead to take advantage!\n",

      "After my horrendous experience with Niro's I was optimistic that Zorba's might have a better gyro.\n",

      "The store is right on Green street and impossible to miss walking by. Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!\n",

      "I decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I did not like was the portion\\/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be back to try more!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gyros are soooo tasty, I keep coming back for more. Price is okay and service is fast. Only complaint would be portion size for their salads...their small was much smaller than in most places, but it was yummy. Seriously try their gyros.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decent gyros at a decent price -- a large gyro combo costs around $7, and less if you manage to get a deal on the Hooked app. The meat is a tad dry, but the sauces somewhat make up for it. 3.5 stars\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What can you say about a campus institution like Zorba's? If you crave great gyros sandwiches and fries served fast, this is the place to visit. Super Niro Gyros serves good food but Zorba's has them beat for a quality product. Not a place to come for ambience, unless you like hanging out with self-absorbed Millennials with hands permanently attached to their iPhones. The tzatziki sauce is worth the price of admission though. Highly recommended.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I took the recommendations of many and did make a reservation for a Saturday night a few days in advance, which was wise because we got the last table available. The space might be tiny, and the chairs might wobble a little bit, but the latin music will keep your body swaying. You will definitely find an authentic Mexican feel compared to any of the other restaurants in the city, but on to the food!\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the grilled corn with lime and quesco fresca. It is permeated with lime, and it tastes as if it has been swimming in a vast sea of lime. It is quite flavourful and delicious. Just wish it came with more cobs!\n",
      "\n",
      "For our mains, we shared a plate of the ancho braised short rib tacos in the golden crispy tortillas, and a plate of tacos al pastor. The better of the two was definitely the ancho braised short rib. The crispy taco sets them apart from some of the other taco joints in the city, and the flavour and texture was quite superior to the tacos al pastor. The only downside is they can be a little messy. The tacos al pastor was pretty light on the pineapple, and could have used a little sauce, and even seemed smaller than the short rib. Plus they came in a soft tortilla shell which wasn't as special. I don't think I'd order them again. On the other hand, the short rib tacos were good enough that we ordered another round.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on to dessert. The tres leches cake was amazing and one of the best desserts I've ever had. At a reasonable 7 dollars, and big enough for sharing. This is a dessert you don't want to pass on. It isn't overall sweet, and it doesn't taste one note. I found the taste and texture of the dessert transformed in my mouth and finished differently on both accounts. 5 stars for this dessert, and would be the main reason I would go back. It will leave you feeling good about your choice of passing on a McFlurry from McDonald's on the way home, and if that is not a win, I don't know what is.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "First of all, the restaurant is hard to find and we passed by a few times. The Google map led us to the wrong location (almost one block west). \n",

      "My review is based on my lunch time experience. Two of us shared two appetizers and one burrito. \n",
      "\n",
      "Poblano corn crab cake with fresh Dungeness crab - they have rich taste of crab and the sauce is very, but I wish the crab meat could be more moist in terms of texture\n",
      "\n",
      "Tacos de Pulpo (our favourite)\n",
      "- First I couldn't find it from the main course Taco section, but found it in the appetizer. A order comes with two tacos. Each one has a big piece of tentacle with spicy guacamole and corn topping. The tentacle is very tender and flavourful. Love this dish very much!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Toluca Chorizo Burrito\n",
      "- Chorizo is flavourful and well mixed with rice and the sunny side up Egg enhance the flavour and texture. The green and red tomato sauce are nicely down. The portion is quite sizeable for one person. Recommend to share it with others so you can try their appetizers and dessert!\n",

      "\n",
      "When we showed up the place was pretty full, both inside and on the patio. We asked one waiter what the wait was for a table inside (as it was pretty chilly out) he said 30-45 minutes, I was so sad! Luckily another waiter spotted us and told us there was a table of 2 that had just cleared up - so we eagerly took a seat.\n",

It is served in a chilled, salt-rimmed glass) - it wasn't on the Menu - so if you haven't tried it yet - I definitely recommend it! To eat: We ordered Ceviche del Dia (I am Peruvian and so by default am a ceviche judge), 3 Tacos de Pescado (Baja Style) and 3 Tacos Ancho braised Shortrib brisket Crispy Tacos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The server punched in the Ceviche but the kitchen never saw it, so they forgot about the Ceviche, which had me a bit bummed at first, but then when I was about finished my third taco, I  realized it was probably a blessing in disguise... I was absolutely full! The Tacos were great, they Brisket tacos, had pico de gallo, frejoles and guac, they were very rich in flavours, very tasty; and the fish tacos were larger and more filling than I expected, fried goodness - squeeze that whole lime wedge on top and you have perfection!!\n",
      "\n",
      "So overall, I would definitely return and have remained super curious to try out their Ceviche, thus *Terminator Voice* I WILL be back!\n",

      "It gets very packed, even late at night (I think their kitchen closes at 11 on weeknights), but it's worth the fifteen minute wait at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've never traveled to Mexico, so I can't give you an opinion on the authenticity of the food. What I can tell you is that everything they serve is fresh and delicious. You can basically point at the menu at random and be satisfied with what comes to your table.\n",
      "\n",

      "WORDS OF WARNING: Now, I'm a fan of spicy heat. But I was stupid enough to go b-deep into a hot paste that was on the table. Call me stupid or call me cocky; whatever. But I was dying, left gargling a glass of cold milk for a half an hour. ...stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR Great value, great food, great service. Watch out for the habanero paste in the jar unless you're cooler than me.\n"

They are ALWAYS bust so don't bother trying to go without a reservation unless maybe on a weekday around 5. They do allow you to make online reservations, but they're usually pretty booked up for weeks in advance and don't accommodate large groups. Anyway, the food is delicious so I guess it's worth it!\n",

      "Went last night for my birthday dinner with my fiance. The service was slow-going for a while as we were not seen for 10 minutes after being seated. I had to let the hostess know, and she told us the name of the fellow who was to be our server and that she would go get him. \n",
      "Oddly it was not the person she had mentioned who ended up greeting us, but I'm thankful for that because we watched the other guy throughout his shift and he didn't seem incredibly knowledgeable or attentive. Our server was quick, friendly, and professional! (Ask for Raoul if you're there!)\n",

They're massive though, and shareable if you don't feel like taking home a doggie-bag! I had to pack mine up.  \n",

      "My side of guacamole had an avocado pit in the ramekin, which took up quite a bit of it. I didn't want to make a fuss though but I found it extremely peculiar that they would miss that detail. The side of guac was $2.50 and was very small. \n",

      "This was my first experience here and very positive, regardless of the rain and the fact that we had to move inside. We were 6 for lunch and the service was friendly. It's a small place so expect the coziness and loudness. Food is very good and the potent Margarita's are quite delish! Will definitely be back for dinner.\n",

      "A totally enjoyable meal. We started with the gauc and chips. Yum. For my main I had the chorizo burrito with pinto beans. It was delicious and the serving was large enough that I have leftovers for tomorrow's dinner. Our server was attentive and pleasant and our food came out promptly. As we were leaving, four separate employees thanked us for coming. iI would come back!\n",

      "I came here on a Friday night with reservations for two (Tip: make reservations! I tried to come once before this without one and the wait was insane). It has a casual, relaxing and fun vibe to it. The washed-out wooden accents give the place that beach house feel that the restaurant is named after. We had the best seat right at the front of the restaurant with open windows looking out to the street. Awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "They really do appreciate food presentation here. Near the back half of the restaurant they had all the seafood sitting on ice! Lobster, crab, oysters. This ice tray of deliciousness was positioned near the guy that likely prepares it and some other dishes. It made me want to order the seafood, so good on them.\n",

      "We shared the guac and chips. Their chips are so good! Fresh and crunchy like they should be. For my main I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (Baja style). Also excellent. If you're getting an appetizer to share I would recommend getting these tacos without the beans and rice. They were very filling on their own. They had this light but creamy coleslaw mix on top of the battered fish which was a nice contrast to the deep-fried-ness of the fish. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and made good recommendations. The only downside to the evening was the time it took for our appetizer and food to be served: longer than normal. I also wish their sipping tequila wasn't $14 minimum an ounce, I passed on it this time. It's expensive because it's excellent quality, so I understand. The cheaper tequilas were ones you shoot and they had a huge selection. I will have to explore their tequila menu more next time I'm here!\n",

The ceviche not so much. I love the vibe of this place and it's a nice break from the noisy and overly crowded taco restaurants in the downtown core. It has become my new favorite restaurant for tacos\\/burritos.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went today with a friend for lunch. great service, split the grilled fish tacos (TACOS DE PESCADO (BAJA-STYLE) and slow roasted pork tacos (TACOS DE CARNITAS). The chicharones on the carnitas were such a great textural lift. Guac was fine, chips with it were better. Will return for some ceviche. Only thing is we didn't eat fast enough and the soft tortillas were tearing. Great atmosphere- very cozy\\/friendly.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Here you will find amazing guacamole prepared to your spice tolerance and accompanied by homemade tortilla chips, grilled corn, tacos and other favourites served up with the best Margaritas in the city.  The Margaritas deserve a second sentence to express just how good they are with many variations in flavour and tequila.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just have a couple qualms: 1) the prices would be a little lower in cities with more Mexican options and 2) please expand!\n",

      "This cute beach shack tucked away in a quaint Dupont\\/ Davenport neighbourhood peaked my curiosity.  I have driven by it a few times and it always looked busy so it was definitely on my hit list to try.  It was a Saturday night on one of our snow falls in Toronto.  It was awful outdoor weather for both driving and walking as people forget how to drive in snow and the flakes are blowing everywhere so it's hard to look up.  I finally stumble into the intimacy of Playa Cabana only to find a very busy and bustling restaurant with all tables full, a line up of folks crowding in the small entranceway and a waiting list that only has openings in about an hour and a half. \n",
      "We luckily get seated only after waiting 15 minutes!\n",
      "We start with the house made guacamole which is delicious and freshly prepared.  It is reminiscent of my favourite guac in the city from Chimichangas (now closed) and the owner may know a thing or two as Dave was the former co-owner there. \n",
      "I also want to try the cerviche which is pickerel.  It comes packed with a good kick and is a big appetizer meant for sharing!\n",
      "The vegetarian burrito and it was a humungous portion but so delicious, my friend was able to polish it without issue.  I ordered the baja fish tacos which came grilled \n",
      "They are one of the best fish tacos I've had and I ate at another trendy mexican resto earlier that week so it's a bold statement!  For more heat - we were given 2 house made hot sauces:  the habanero salsa- WOAH - this gives you a big kick of heat but it creeps up on you.   The other one was the roasted chile arboles salsa - which gives you some good heat and is just right for me.\n",

They give an appetizer platter for the table for free, which nearly filled us up as is. The tacos were amazing and the staff friendly and helpful. I only took away a star as it was so loud in there it's hard to hear your table and have to talk on the top of your voice. I'll definitely recommend and will be back, especially if I don't mind a bit of a headache that night lol\n",

      "The place is small and quaint, but is very popular in the evening creating a very tight space. However I could look past that because the food is amaaaaazing! My boyfriend and I ordered drinks, snapper ceviche, chorizo tacos & short rib tacos and finished off with churros. It was truly a love at first bite! At first I was worried about portions, as everything look small on yelp, however food was soo filling! The staff was warm and welcoming however they were not as attentive as they should've been. They were quick to seat us & say hello but didn't take initiative to check on their tables, instead most servers were huddled around the bar just socializing. This caused quite a waiting game when I was in need for water or when we wanted to order our mains & dessert. I'd only hope the service is better the next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm not going to lie - have never been the biggest fan of Mexican food. That being said, had a very good experience here. I think what stands out the most is really the atmosphere of the place - very European feel. A real pleasure to go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was 7\\/10. Had the beef flutes, civiche, guacamole, salsa, and fish tacos. Overall, very well prepared, but the tastes weren't 100% to my liking, again, possibly biased haha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, the group was very happy with the meal, and the Sangria was pretty good (ask for less ice). Parking isn't too hard to find by the way, but you should expect to look on the streets. I'd say it's a great date place as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "In between our office and hotel, this was the perfect choice for us. We were seated in the back alcove . They sell beers by the bucket so we said why not? Our server was nice and didn't rush us or anything. I got the carnitas tacos and they were good. Pretty authentic food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really enjoyed the dinner. Guacamole was excellent. Split some fish and chicken tacos and really liked both. The only knock is that there was no beer on tap; bottle selection was good though.\n",

I was surprised by how delicious the food was but I was dismayed by some aspects of the service. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, despite the fact that the restaurant was not remotely busy, we were not approached by a server for at least ten minutes after being seated. In fact, the hostess had to ask another server to see us because our intended one just kind of fu*ked off and attended to maintaining his bizarre Caucasian-Last-Samurai-topknot-bro-on-a-spiritual-granola-journey haircut.  Thanks, guy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our replacement server, Raul, kept the party going and did the damn thing and did so promptly and politely. Commendations to Raul. The food was to our liking, although it does kind of feel like you're paying for the restaurant's comforts when you can get the same caliber food at a truck in Los Angeles for a fraction of the cost. Despite the omitted fifth star, I would urge folks in Toronto desperate for a quality Mexican food experience to try this place out. DEFINITELY make reservations first. There is no harm in doing so and it struck me as the sort of place that is frequently busy, as it was tonight.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent. Tried the corn as an appetizer - must have. And then we ordered a burrito (huge) and the enmoladas (also great). Then we tried the Tres Leches cake - honestly the best I've ever had, a MUST HAVE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely recommended\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "4.5 stars. This place isn't that big so I understand why there are line ups.  My hubby and I arrived in between lunch and dinner so we came at a good time.  Their portions are generous and it feels and tastes like authentic mexican food.  Packed full of flavour.  The meat pork in the playa burrito was divine and my tacos were juicy yet crispy from the shells.  I will go back to try the other items on the menu.\n",

      "Came here about a month ago on a Sunday afternoon. There was a big group of us and we all left very happy and satisfied. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff were great. They took really good care of our big group. Being such a large group, we just asked one of the servers to recommend\\/order for us. Unfortunately, I forget his name...but he did an awesome job. We had a good variety of items. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was awesome! Lots of flavour. I don't think there was anything we didn't like. Some of the favorites amongst the group included the shrimp bucket, lobster taco, both types of fish taco, and braised short-rib taco. They were all very tasty and served with a healthy portion of meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one mishap during the meal though...one of the sangrias came with a loooooooong strand of hair :S (It was stuck on the ice cube...) They were very apologetic and a fresh one was made right away. \n",

      "Regardless, we had a wonderful experience and we'll definitely be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Going to this place has become a ritual for my boyfriend and I. We go every year when the patio opens. We don't go more often only because we eat way too much every time. I'd recommend getting more appetizers than meals. My fav combo is the guac, the corns and the shrimp (sorry I don't recall the Spanish words). I personally didn't love the Chorizo sausage. It was too spicy and saucy for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service has room for improvement. Last time we were here we had to wait for the menus for 20 minutes, but to their defence it was super busy on the patio and it's not like they could fit any more servers. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So you and your friend have a hankering for Mexican food  while downtown....I wanted to see if this place was about the food or about the flash. Located at 111 Davenport Rd, ( note: they have a second location in the junction) it is a little hidden from the main strip of the Avenue Rd \\/ Yorkville restaurants. It felt to me more of a locals hangout as the customers and staff seemed familiar with each other. \n",
      "The restaurant is small and cozy with a very nice patio. Decor was nice and tasteful unlike some other Mexican places that want to scream at you that they are Mexican (Also, I'm glad they didn't do that whole \"day of the dead\" theme that a lot of places are doing these days) anyway, now to the food. \n",
      "They have a good menu that highlights the usual fare. Tacos, enchiladas, as well as main plates. The liquor menu is what you would expect in a Mexican restaurant with lots of tequila choices and Mexican beer. ( $20 for a 5 bucket of beer) I started with a Dave's margarita on he rocks( they don't serve the slushy kind) and the usual guacamole dip and the daily ceviche both served in a stone bowl and made fresh. Both were excellent and well made. I opted for the Carne Asada platter with beans and rice and tortillas. The presentation was nice and the portions were good. Now I have had this dish at other places before (in Mexico) and I prefer my meat cooked and served without sauce on it. The flank steak was good but it was cover in the sweet sauce that overpowered the flavour of the meat. The sauce was good and maybe it should be used as a side but not smothering the meat. Everything else was cooked perfectly and very tasteful.  Overall this place is good and well deserving of a try. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the sauce over the meat thing ....mmmm meat....\n"

      "- The salsa appetizer with daily made tortillas was an excellent appetizer to share - although I usually prefer my salsa ingredients diced rather than blended, it was still very good.\n",
      "- We had originally ordered the ceviche but the server forgot to put in our order and we only realized once our mains were served with no sign of the ceviche - thought it would be odd to eat ceviche with our burritos so asked for salsa and tortillas instead. The salsa and tortillas was then comped for us, so we were satisfied \n",

I hate when my food is lukewarm... I just didn't want to send it back when we already dealt with the appetizer issue. \n",

      "The space is a bit cramped, so it's probaly not the best option for an intimate one-on-one. Music can be a bit loud. On the plus side, our server was friendly and very attentive. And considering all the food we ordered, the bill at the end of the night was also pretty reasonable.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place deserves its great food reviews. Their shortrib crispy tacos are about the most flavourful thing I've had in any Mexican restaurant in Toronto (including all those places open in the past couple of years where people like to line up for tacos) - assuming you like the idea of moist, saucy meat, freshly deep-fried shell, oozy cheese and creamy cool crema and guac on the side. I'm not an expert on \"authenticity\", but it's definitely delicious and not watered down for gringos.  They always have a daily ceviche and the fish tacos are great too. It tends to get really busy and may not be a good place to bring squirmy kids, but it's not hard to get a seat for two at off-peak hours. Their nacho chips are also freshly deep fried and crispily addictive.\n",

      "Playa Cabana definitely lived up to the hype. Went with a large group which presented the opportunity to do a tasting menu of a variety of different tacos and some apps as share plates. Listing everything would be an endeavour but the stand outs were definitely the fresh, flakey fish tacos, savoury rib steak tacos, and flavourful octopus tacos. The tostadas were impressive and the in-house hot sauces were all phenomenal. Definitely made a lasting impression, not to mention a great tequila selection and cocktail list.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went to Playa Cabana with a relatively large group (12-13 people) and they were great. I had the Guaca Fresca, which was amazing. Large portion of guacamole (mild is actually not spicy at all), and the chips were delicious as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the main, I had the Tacos De Pescado, which is the fish tacos. The tacos were on the sour-side of the taste palette, especially with the coleslaw in it. I would recommend not putting any more lime on it. The fish was very fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, customer service was great as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The quaint atmosphere and super friendly staff were fantastic. Great margaritas, good price, great food. Tacos were sobgood we ordered twice. It is a bit tight between tables but everyone was very kind about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Went there with some older folks (who were a bit put off by the high decibel levels) on a Thursday night: it was packed! I thought it was a great place to get good booze and will come back with similarly aged people for a more fun experience (basically for more alcohol).\n",
      "\n",
      "The guac was amazing: not too heavy and very fresh. The surf and turf burritto could've fed an entire mexican village! It was very well done but I would've preferred the orange sauce on the side instead of submerging the burrito in it. I prefer my dishes spicy so I asked for their spicy salsa and our server got me two kinds of spicy salsa. I absolutely loved them both! So folks ask for the spicy salsa. The churros were great as well: doughy, cinnamony,creamy!\n",

      "I had the Amber agave and it was, hands down, the best margarita I've had!  I really wanted to order another one, but unfortunately couldn't because I had to drive later that night.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the guaca fresca ($8), which was absolutely delicious! It was so fresh and creamy, I just wanted to eat this all night long! The guaca fresca comes in mild, medium, and hot. We asked for mild and they gave us two types of hot sauce on the side. I enjoyed both of them, but the habanero one (on the left) was really quite spicy, even for me. The other one- a roasted chile arboles salsa- was just perfect!\n",
      "\n",
      "tacos de pescado ($13) Baja-style with catch of the day, fresh battered with Tecate-cerveza. I can't recall what the catch of the day was, but I didn't particularly care for it. The fish wasn't as flaky and light as I'd like it to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ancho braised short rib-brisket crispy tacos ($14)- AAA Ontario Beef short rib braised in ancho chiles wrapped in fresh corn tortillas and griddled to a golden crispiness, served with pico de gallo, guacamole and homemade crema. This was definitely a heavier taco, and the flavours were also a lot bolder. The short rib-brisket combination was extremely juicy, resulting in an incredibly messy eating process (not that I'm complaining). All in all, I enjoyed the crispy taco, but it was so filling that I wouldn't be able to eat more than one.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Playa burrito with pork carnitas ($14), served with fresh guac, pico de gallo, crema, green tomatillo sauce and red tomato sauce. I'm not a big fan of  burritos in general, but I've read so many great reviews about the ones here that I was sorely tempted to try one. First of all, I thought the presentation was so pretty with the two contrasting sauces. Secondly, the portion was huge- our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomach! I was intimidated by the sheer massiveness of all the that pork, rice and beans- it was almost like a brick. In the end, Mel and I struggled to finish the whole burrito, and neither of us liked the green tomatillo sauce that much. To be fair, this was probably a very good burrito, but it was just not for me\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it was a birthday celebration, we obviously had to have dessert! First up, an order churros ($6). Unfortunately, I didn't love this version, as the dough was a little too dense and   the flavours were lacking a punch because they ran out of the cajeta dipping sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second dessert was a traditional Mexican flan ($7), and while it didn't look very pretty, the flavours certainly made up its looks. The flan was velvety smooth and rich, and even the side of whipped cream was delectable!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed dinner at Playa Cabana. The drinks were excellent, and I'd come back just for the guaca fresca! Though next time, I'd probably stay away from the burrito.\n"

It's a little bit pricier than some of the other places in Kensington Market but they offer some really good stuff here. One of my personal favorite is the Playa burrito. It's so filling you can probably split it with someone. They also have a really big patio at the back so don't be fooled by how tiny the storefront looks. Service was really slow but good made up for it.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. The tacos are a bit small, but they are fresh and delicious. I would order the chicken tacos again. (Be warned! Some of the table sauces are quite spicy!)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If you like guacamole, you will love their chips and guacamole. The chips, which can be a tinge greasy, are tasty and made in house.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The service, aside from being a bit rushed, was good. The recommendations for food and drinks were perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The vibe is loud and fun. I noticed that there was quite a diverse crowd here, which is nice as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. They have indoor and outdoor seating. To be mere steps from the corner of Davenport and Dupont, the outdoor patio seems quite removed from city traffic and noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great spot. There probably aren't many places in Toronto that can match Playa Cabana for Mexican food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Positively delicious food. But unfortunately, service is on and off (and when it's off, it's positively terrible). On the other hand, if you're served by the right person, you're in good hands. \n",
      "\n",
      "We visited for dinner on a weekday evening and we were seated dismissively by a server who waved us towards the direction of an empty table. Then we sat there and waited. And waited. And waited. For someone to give us a pair of menus. The place wasn't busy at all; servers were just sitting around involved in their own conversations. We tried to wave someone down several times to get a hold of menus, but no cigar. Because, obviously, we came to your restaurant just to sit, twiddle our thumbs, and stare at people eating (not). A good 20 minutes went by before a server came by and asked us what we wanted to order... unfortunately, without a menu we had no idea what to order. She seemed embarrassed that no one had given us menus or had greeted us yet, and brought us menus from the front. From that point forward, service was perfectly fine, as our server attempted to make up for the cold beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the guacamole and chips appetizer, the tacos de carnitas, braised short rib brisket  tacos, and a playa burrito. Absolutely delicious. My highlight was definitely the guacamole and chips combo - the chips were homemade, crunchy, and didn't taste like the usual run-of-the-mill corn chips you can get just anywhere. So delicious and had a very interesting texture - they definitely tasted and felt homemade. The burrito was quite large and a bit hard to eat, but the meat in both the burrito and the tacos were very tender and perfectly cooked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance is super dim and romantic - this is a great spot for a date or even dinner with friends. Very casual, relaxing atmosphere. For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $58.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I eat burritos like they're candy.\n",
      "So to have a burrito placed in front of me that was so exquisitely sculpted, dressed, topped and stuffed - it would have felt like a crime to inhale it. I savoured every bite of the Carne Molida Picadillo burrito. Even the margarita I had was fresh and delicious. And looking around the table, it doesn't seem like you can go wrong with whatever you order.\n",
      "\n",

Guacamole + homemade chips are also delicious. The place can get a bit crammed, but a cool vibe overall. Would definitely recommend! Also, excellent service!!\n",

I'm not the most well-versed in all things Mexican, but this place comes off quite authentic - from when you first step over the threshold of what used to be a house to this small, intimate restaurant with Mexican music playing. They even had the heat turned up because my glasses fogged up as soon as I came in from the brisk March air.

      "We then had pescada tacos+ the tacos al pastor. The tacos were bigger or at least fuller than expected, but the quality was still there so good bang for the buck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the Mexican restaurants I've been to this is one of the best. The place is small so reserve! It's cramped but a fun cramped, like you're all part of the same big party visiting your new Mexican in-laws at a big pre wedding dinner! Except there we no Mexican nationals there to my knowledge, but you can imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a worth the visit.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We made a reservation at Playa Cabana a few days prior for 3PM on a Saturday afternoon. When we arrived at 2:30PM a little early for our reservation the place was packed. They were able to seat us early and were very accommodating. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is small and tight with a casual & fun atmosphere. It was loud but not so loud you couldn't hear each other. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The chips and salsa are very good as were the other items we ordered.\n",

      "If you are planning to go, make a reservation, you will be happy you did.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great place! Good authentic Mexican food and nice atmosphere (though a little cramped). Had the choriqueso tacos, the meat was well seasoned and cooked right, the cheese was queso Oaxaca, you can't usually find that here and when you do it's often not good but not in this case. Service was prompt, it's a small place but they had plenty of people on staff. Would definitely dine here again. \n",

      "By the way, I'm Mexican so believe me when I say it's authentic.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We went there for our second anniversary. Place is cozy. Food is delish! For dessert we had the chocolate jar cake. It was AMAZING!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had a great time dining here- the service was attentive, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was lively. \n",
      "\n",
      "We shared all of our plates. In my opinion, the highlights were the massive burritos (ordered the breaded chicken one) and the pork tacos. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food took ages to arrive, so for some this may be an issue, but we were quite happy with our chips with (amazing) salsa and pitchers of margaritas!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the churros for dessert and found them to be a bit heavy\\/ overdone.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently there is  a great patio in the summer. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for something fun and casual. I look forward to returning!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really great service and overall experience. For how exciting and innovative the dishes sounded - some of them fell a bit flat with regards to flavors. However, the cocktails were wonderful and we got our meals in great time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend you do not get seated in the back of the restaurant - it is a bit too close to the hot kitchen and much darker than other areas of the restaurant.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is probably one of my favourite Mexican restaurants in Toronto right now! I'm not Mexican so I can't vouch for authenticity, but the flavours were spot on! \n",
      "My friend and I shared the shrimp bucket for appetizers:\n",
      "Simply delicious butter and spice marinade! The only difficulty I found was in getting the shell off the shrimp meat, which was a disappointment because the shell taken on most of the flavour!\n",
      "\n",
      "For our main course we opted for the beef short rib tacos:\n",
      "These were amazing! The taco shell (I think they used paratha instead of a traditional corn shell?) was crispy while the beef inside was the best I've had! It comes with various toppings and a decent portion of guacamole which goes perfectly! \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't remember his name, but our server was amazing. Although it got busy super fast, my glass of water was never empty! \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely make a reservation beforehand as it is a small place, but soo worth it. (Especially if you're looking for spicy food - they had the best chillies)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great little restaurant! We almost missed it when we parked. My boyfriend and I showed up on a Saturday night without reservations, and luckily they had a table available immediately. I would recommend making reservations, as the dining area is small and always busy. \n",
      "\n",
      "What it lacks in size, it makes up for in quality of food. Toronto isn't known for their Mexican food, but this place breaks the mould. We ordered the guac and chips to start, baja fish tacos and steak burrito as mains, and the homemade lemonade to drink. The food was fresh and flavorful. The lemonade was on the sweet side, but good. We left full and happy and will be returning.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our friends suggested this place to us when we went to visit them in Toronto as this is their go-to spot for great Mexican food and I can definitely see why ! The food was so fresh and flavourful and the portions were very filling and for a great price ! we shared the spicy shrimp bucket to start , the shrimp were nice and big and very fresh but if you're not a fan of spicy this may not be the choice for you. butttttt if you like spicy food like I do then these are a great choice - muy caliente ! We also had the octopus taco which I was very excited about since I love octopus but I never really had it in taco form - it was delicious (also spicy) the octopus was grilled to perfection and the fresh corn and fresh toppings made it even better. As the main course my boyfriend and I shared the chorizo burrito which came topped with a fried egg, salsa Roja, salsa verde and cotija cheese. The burrito is pretty big and pretty freaking delicious ! (Though not really spicy but very flavourful). For dessert we shared the tres leches cake which was so light and not overly sweet. Also worth mentioning is the fact that they offer indoor and outdoor seating and do serve a variety of beers and cocktails. My only complaint is that the indoor seating is a little bit tight so there's not much room but as soon as the awesome food came I forgot all about that ! All in all I really enjoyed playa cabana and think it's a great spot to go with some friends or a date for some great Mexican food !\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A friend and I were looking for a nice lunch spot after visiting castle Casaloma. We came across this small but cozy authentic Mexican place. They served us house made chips with guacamole as appetizers. The guacamole is served in a molcajete (stone bowl). I thought that was pretty cool!!\n",
      "For our mains we got fish tacos (Tacos de Pescado) and beef short rib tacos (Ancho Braised Short rib crispy Tacos). They were amazing!!\n",
      "I would definitely go back to this place on a daily base if I lived in Tdot. Thank you Playa Cabana!! I will be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "No Chimichangas here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice restaurant in an offbeat location on Dupont. Easy to get to if you get off at St George subway and just walk straight up Bedford for 5 minutes to Dupont. Its basically right there. Small little place which gets larger with the amazing patio on the outside. We started out on the patio but unfortunately the rain took us inside to a very hip locale with bar seating in the middle of the restaurant. Not sure what it was but there was lots of groups of young women at the restaurant this night.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was quick and had waters to our table super quick. Unfortunately two of the three waters had remnents of left over food items in them. Getting past this the night only got better. The food was fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the Guacamole\\/chips. Loved the baked tortillia chips. The Guac was tasty also.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a burrito which was beyond huge. Filled with chicken, rice, black beans and all sorts of other goodness was super tasty and super rich. Desert? After you just served that oversized piece of goodness? Don't think so. Overall a super spot and fairly reasonablly priced food. Drinks were slighly pricey but where aren't they these days.\n",

      "Order the Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos!!! Amazingly delicious. Slap- your- mama -in- the- face good! The Ceviche is a great app, their guac is really authentic and good too. My only complaint is if you sit indoors its pretty cramped. I was elbowed in the head at least 2 times, but on the plus side the waiter was good looking. Fish tacos are a little bland. \n",
      "Decent prices too.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The short rib tacos are the bomb diggity! Never knew you could put rib meat into tacos, but I'm glad they invented it. Perfectly sweet with a nice tangy finish. Rich and diverse. Excellent mouthfeel too - that short rib was tender and moist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish tacos sucked though. It's a catch of the day dish, and today's was baja. We got grilled (as opposed to battered) at the recommendation of our server. It looked kinda bland, tasted bland (reminiscent of overlooked and browned scrambled eggs) and was soggy to the point where the soft tortilla fell apart in my hands and I had to eat the taco ashamedly with a fork and knife. Save your fish taco cravings for seven lives in Kensington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guac and chips appetizer was real nice. The guac comes in a nice stone mortar (great looking touch), and comes in three spicy levels: mild medium spicy. The spicy level has the perfect kick to it - spicy, but not overbearing. The chips are homemade and fried - hint of egg, and real tasty, although some -very few- were a bit too oily).\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend's recommended the Mexican iced tea. Apparently delicious and strong. Gonna have to get next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall experience was really good! Ordered the enchiladas suizas filled with pork and it was delicious...I cleaned the plate inc. all rice and beans.  For 15$ you can't go wrong.  Also shared the beef shortrib tacos and that's where I had to give it a 4\\/5.  The meat hands down delicious,  the hard taco shell on the other hand was greasy and tasted like old oil.  Too bad I was looking forward to it.  All desserts were good too...sample a bit of each!\n",

      "\n",
      "This time, we made reservation a couple of hours before, and went there on a Thursday. What we didn't know, is that they have two locations really close of each other. So, we ended up walking back to Playa Cabana.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the decoration and the patio. They have a trendy, modern, mexican-cantina vibe. Which was reflected in that delicious \"paloma\" I drank. It hasn't been common for me to find this drink abroad. Never thought I would find it in the perfect proportion of authentic ingredients. This paloma, was the best cocktail appetizer I had this year.\n",

      "Palomas, tequila, and beer!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was really cool that they serve the salsa and the guacamole on the \"molcajetes\". The guacamole had too much lime for my taste, but the salsa was perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite item was: tacos de pulpo. A shame they treat them like appetizers, because they would be awesome like main course. The flavor hypnotized me, but they were only two, too small and with just one tortilla. I wanted to order more, but I was afraid it was going to be too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tacos de langosta where the ones I didn't like much. Too greasy, messy and blah. The hardshell tastes like a bunuelo (fried bread), not like tortilla. You can't hold them, cut them or bite them in peace. They had enough lobster, but they lacked flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality and flavor of my other options was great. I recommend them.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I dream about this place. Their guacamole and bottomless chips are addictive. My friends and I devoured two orders of it and they just kept asking us if we wanted more chips. Um, yes. Never stop giving them to me. The enchiladas suizas are amazing, and the jarritos are a nice non-alcoholic option. The tres leches cake makes me want to cry, it's so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a tiny place so make sure to have reservations, and it's good to note that it can get very loud. If you can deal with a somewhat cramped and lively space for the fantastic food, then you need to try this place.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "***1\\/2 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Playa Cabana is nestled on a residential street at Davenport and Dupont.  Rumours about not being able to get in without a reservation are definitely true - even at lunch time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came here on a Friday afternoon around 1:30PM and the place was packed.  Just when hopes of a table came up, we were told the fellas at the bar had dibs on it.  I can see why because the bar was definitely cramped when it came to leg room in an already small restaurant.  I would say it seats no more than 40 and the servers really have to do a whole dance to maneuver around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one good thing that came of sitting at the bar is a full frontal view of the kitchen as well as one of the best bartenders in the city.  He was attentive, entertaining and makes, in my humble opinion, one of the best Mojitos in the city.  While you can opt for the traditional (made with rum) - tequila lovers can rejoice as he offers that as an alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sign on the wall proudly announces that they make their own soft shell corn tortillas in house - a bragging right that most restaurants cannot herald.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the Guaca Fresca ($8) which comes in mild, medium or spicy.  We opted for the spicy and didn't find it to be spicy.  The guac itself was rather bland, as were the chips.  A far cry from the lime-salted tortilla chips at Grand Electric.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also opted to share the Cubeta de Camaron ($16), a 1 lb bucket of shrimp tossed in an Arbol-garlic butter, Cancun style.  These were delicious.  I liked the spices and the shrimp were grilled to a nice pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "For mains we shared the Tacos de Pescado ($14) and went with the grilled option ($1 more).  All taco dishes come with 3 tacos though you can get 4 to make it more sharable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I simply couldn't leave without an order of Churros - or could I?  In the case of Playa Cabana, I am disappointed to say I could've skipped dessert. My expectation of an airy Churro rolled in cinnamon sugar was nowhere to be found.  Instead, a nightmare of a hard and overly sweet stick (which was probably re-fried) showed up on my plate.  Suffice it to say that this was one (rare) occasion where I didn't finish dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our meal came up to about $69 net of tip.  While I really enjoyed the bucket of shrimp and the tacos were delicious and fresh; as a whole Grand Electric is still my favourite joint when I'm in the mood for Mexican.  The weak points of my meal here were definitely the guac and the Churros.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the sign above the large communal table read \"Todo chido\" (it's cool).  I'll likely be back to try out their burritos in the near future.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had a margarita that did not contain simple syrup.(can't remember the name, but it is the second on the margarita list)  It was tart and delicious.  BTW this is an authentic style place, so there are no frozen margaritas.  This suited me just fine.  It's not summer anymore!\n",
      " \n",
      "The tacos are a la carte, and where this differs from a little place in Mexico is that they are priced at $6, instead of $1... So much for authenticity, lol. \n",

      "I had the grilled haddock taco - skip this. BLAND\n",
      "\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Playa Cabana is a Mexican restaurant in Toronto open for lunch and dinner near the popular Yorkville area. They have three locations but I frequent original the 111 Dupont location.There are a few really great Mexican restaurants in Toronto but what I love about Playa Cabana is that it isn't a nutritional death sentence. There are quite a few pretty healthy options that are delicious and filling. The food is fresh and well priced. They also have a great tequila selection and delicious homemade chips. The space is small and cosy and in the summer they have a small patio in the back.\n",
      "The burrito is big enough to share and I would recommend sharing a little bit of everything. Their ceviche is always fresh and bursting with citrus. The brisket tacos are incredible but very heavy. This is a great place for a fun group dinner, boozy brunch or casual dinner. Strongly recommend getting a reservation.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Place\\/Ambience: small and gets busy everyday. Went on a Monday night, weather was bad and it was raining, but this place was still packed and there were people lining to get a table. We were a group of 8 and got seats because we went early at 6pm. The ambience was good. A little dim, but that is perfect for a social gathering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food:  We did not know what to get and asked our waiter for recommendations. He was very patient and told us the popular dishes, while explaining how each is cooked. I got the Tacos Al Pastor upon his suggestion. The pork was marinated overnight and slowly cooked. It was very good and very flavourful, although the portion was not very big. I also ordered the Mojito Cubana. Not the best mojito I tried, and was a bit on the sour side. My advice, skip the mojitos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely go back again if I am feeling Mexican.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a very hidden place on Dupont street. It looks like a random quite house from the outside, but when you entered, it turns a very busy pub. I ordered the burrito and I like it! It's full of juicy, good quality beef, black beans, and rice. I've never seen any burrito would give me that much beef though! And they drizzled two different sauces, gives the burrito two totally different taste. Very entertaining!\n",

For Bocaditos we ordered the holy coupling of Guaca Fresca along with Fresh Salsa both served in lava rock molcajete bowls.  Eating guac and salsa this good and piquantly fresh, it was hard not to take advantage of refills for the delightfully crisp hand-pressed tortilla chips.  \n",

      "For mains I got the Baja Style Tacos De Pescado which are soft shell fish tacos fresh battered with Tecate-cerveza.  Mmmmmm, so far I can say these are the best fish tacos I've ever had with just the right ratio of light crumbly crisp batter encasing mouthwatering Tilapia.  My girlfriend ordered the day special of a three taco sampler of chicken, carnitas and brisket and was literally gasping between bites whilst singing their savoury praises.\n",

The tacos are delicious and perfectly sized, and the drinks are always great. It's a pretty tight spot so expect to be seated very close to your neighbors! We had one experience here with incredibly sub-par service, but every other time the servers have been attentive and helpful. Great spot!\n",

      "\n",
      "That said, you could immediately feel the warmth and coziness of Playa (from herein called PC). I know this place is busy, so I called to make a reservation and even then we had to wait for their brand new back patio. It was definitely worth it!  Note: this was at 9 p.m. on a Monday night on a holiday weekend so if you're coming here on a weekend come very early. \n",
      "\n",

      "Back to the back patio: it's very cute! They've got outside heat lamps and trees that make it very intimate and the ideal second date place (good Mexican food deserves to be reserved for date deux or trois). They can also accommodate groups as well and have high tops. It works! \n",

They give you the option to add rice or a salad (but don't mention it's an extra couple of bucks--luckily, my dining companion thought to ask!), but it's not necessary at all.  The patio is lovely, and even though we didn't have a reservation, we were seated right away.  If we'd arrived later though, I'm sure we would have had to wait--by the time we left, around eight, there was a lineup on the sidewalk.\n",

When I first heard where in the city it was, I couldn't picture anything except houses. Needless to say, I was right but this place is an amazing little gem (in a house). \n",
      "\n",

      "We had the ceviche, tacos de pescado (fish), and poblano chile rellenos. The seafood in both of our dishes was incredible. It tasted extremely fresh both raw and cooked. The dishes weren't small either. We could have easily gotten full just on the mains alone. But I like to think my stomach has a 6th gear so I pushed for the ceviche up front. \n",
      "\n",

      "Between my friend and I we ordered the guac (obvious choice here, guys!), the braised ancho shortrib taco and the steak burrito,. I was sick, so couldn't share as I normally do, but am assured that the steak burrito was pretty delicious. The shortrib taco was too though, as mentioned by the many Yelpers before me, incredibly oily. I should have heeded the warning because, after 2 tacos, the grease was too much for me and the 3rd taco was left uneaten. Still, a yummy choice for those that don't mind the oily fingers afterwards. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing preventing this from being a perfect rating was the entirely TOO cozy dining space inside, where we were seated. We were at the bar, knees pressed to the counter and the waiters\\/waitresses still kept bumping us and\\/or the table behind us on their way out to deliver food because the space between was SO small. It's not the fault of the waiters, but there has to be a better way... I can only imagine that this kind of disruption happens every day. \n",

      "Grilled fish taco with rice and black beans $18-20...? - their freshly grilled fish (although not very flavourful) was delicious! Taco usually has two corn tortilla per taco but this place only uses one so our fish taco ripped quickly and made a mess everywhere! The rice and beans were meh - rice tasted like ketchup fried rice.\n",

I have found my love for it and never had a negative experience since our first visit.  Food remains excellent, crowd fun and we always sneak a seat at the bar rather than deal with the clunky tables.  My new go to orders are the Salad with Pork - Yum and the Michilatas(Sp) - also never miss the Guac and the Spicy Mole...go and enjoy and Yeah Playa for being such a great place in our hood.\n",

      "\n",
      "Food is really good, really fresh and authentic.  Definitely a step up from the Mexican places in T.O. that I have tried in the past.  I loved the guacamole and the spicy chicken mole was unbelievable.  We waited a few weeks to get a dinner reservation and in the end decided to try for brunch instead.  I would love to go back for dinner, but they do book in advance.  And we are fun and all, but don't normally have margaritas at brunch, so will have to take the word of other reviews about how amazing they are. \n",

      "1. the space is awkward \\/ tables are too big and place does not seem that clean to me.  They could fit way more people in if they changed the entry and got better tables...\n",

      "Great little place, came here on a Sunday afternoon.  Not a lot of seating.  Started with a bottle of Sol, my friend had a margarita, which she said was excellent.  Nachos and salsa for starters, both made on site and both excellent.  I had chicken enchiladas, with black bean curd and rice, my friend had Octopus tacos (yep!).  Both were excellent.  Highly recommend this place, only drawback is lack of seating, which makes coming here on the fly a bit risky.\n",

      "\n",
      "We boldly rolled up to Playa Cabana with no reservations.  Group of 4.  One of my friends had had dreams of tacos the previous night, so we were willing to wait it out to address her subconscious culinary cravings.  While kicking around the front patio (there's little room at the bar inside, and the front patio has yet to secure a liquor license, so it was a lot of sweating, foot shuffling, and debating how hot we'd want our guacamole as we stood around) we made friends with those waiting around us.  Consensus?  Playa Cabana is worth the wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we made it in (victorious!) we were led through the restaurant.  It's a tight space, and certainly not the most convenient flow.  Blame my overheated body, but A\\/C felt nonexistent.  Solution?  PITCHER OF MARGARITAS POR FAVOR (we opted for the tequila and orange mix).\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was simultaneously frenetic and casual, which in a way really suited the place.  Our server was really friendly, smiled with a twinkle in his eye when we ordered the guacamole spicy (it lived up to its name) and was as attentive as he could be given the many tables and the extremely tight space (which really means, I guess: he wasn't easy to locate, but we were having so much fun that it didn't really matter).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food-wise we tackled the (grilled) Baja-style fish tacos and the crispy chicken tacos, rounding off the order with some churros for dessert.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if this review's enthusiasm comes care of the tequila, but: the food was dynamite.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The guacamole, served in a molcajete, was predominantly smooth with a few chunks and some heat.  The accompanying chips were canola oil fried house-made corn tortillas.  They were on the greasier side, but I'm saying that...as a positive thing.\n",
      "The fish tacos were fresh, and light, and flavourful, with the softness of the fish set against the crunch of the slaw.\n",
      "The crispy chicken tacos were messier (I had to resort to my knife and fork) but the crispy shell was the perfect complement to the soft free-range chicken\n",
      "Churros, well: fried dough is alright by me.  But this was cinnamon-y, sugary, dulce de leche-kissed fried dough.  Mo' bettah.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Worth a special note: Playa Cabana seems determined to show that Mexican food can be healthy.  Fresh salsas, locally sourced dairy, free range chicken, and black and pinto beans cooked in veggie stock (the latter are re-seared with lean pork stock so don't stay vegetarian throughout the process).  Healthy tastes delicious here.  \n",

      "The best guac I've had here in Toronto! Tucked just east of Davenport on Dupont, I found Playa Cubana yesterday for lunch and was very impressed. Though the street-front patio is a little cramped, the food and service were excellent. I think I've found my new favourite Mexican place. Can't wait to try the ceviche'!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So so busy.  Seriously.  Really, really busy.  But great and completely worth the wait.  Some of the best Mexican food I've found in the city so far.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, the food IS as good as everyone's been saying. I would definitely eat there again, but I wouldn't recommend the back patio in the winter time - unfortunately this was our only option as the front room was packed.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Playa is typically Toronto. Five star food, the right amount of cool factor to make it \"in demand\" and great food. Go for the fresh fish tacos, the corn on the cob and the cointreau tequila.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We were driving back from a cottage in Brighton and wanted to pick up food to eat at home. You know, avoid having to make food when we're already so tired? Playa Cabana was on our way and it's one of those spots that we've wanted to try out, but just haven't gotten to.\n",
      "We popped in and ordered the chicken and pastor (soft) tacos and a horchata for while we waited on our order.\n",
      "I found the service to be friendly and overall efficient and extremely fast. The food was done before we even got through half the drink. The horchata, while good, was not as great as we've had elsewhere in the city. I found that it was at once refreshing going down the throat but leaving your mouth with a dry feeling (which made you think you were thirsty).\n",
      "Later when we got home to eat, the shells were coming apart a bit (likely from condensation) but the meat was amazing. The pastor is a bit spicy but delicious and the chicken balanced out the spiciness of our meal.\n",
      "While there, we discussed how the location was compact which created a sense of intimacy, but it wasn't romantic in the classic sense, making it a great spot for new dates. We will return to dine in someday, and hopefully have a chance to visit the other Playa locations, to be able to compare all of them!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Walked in between the lunch time & dinner time rush and immediately got seated at our table. While the place is quite cramped, it had that semi-cozy & loud cantina feel that I felt for a minute that I was in a busy cantina somewhere in Mexico!\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a pitcher of the \"amber\" margarita, crab cakes, chicken tinga tostadas, grilled fish tacos and the tres leches cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crab cakes were on the small side, yet really appetizing that led  us to crave for more of what's to come. Both the chicken tinga tostadas (2 pcs) and the grilled fish tacos (3 pcs) were really really fresh and tasty. I also liked their variation of chili sauces on the table (chopped fresh chilies, chili chipotle, red and green sauces), and yes they were indeed HOT - which were perfect to complement any dish you order. The highlight of the meal was the amazing tres leches cake - satisfyingly moist, decadent, and refreshing all at the same time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the food looked like they were not much portion-wise, but don't let that deceive you. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have an amazingly tasty and authentic food with great ambience, it'll make you forget you're stil in the city!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We got takeout from this place a while back. Overall, I quite enjoyed the food. It would be a 5 star place if their prices where maybe 20-25% lower. We ordered the following items:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS\n",
      "This was pretty tasty but very messy to eat. Sauce and grease everywhere. I would order it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "- POLLO MILANESA CHIPOTLE BURRITO\n",
      "This was really good. Better than the tacos IMO.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm a Texan and my girlfriend is from San Diego, so we know good Mexican when we eat it, and this is excellent Mexican. The dishes were fresh and authentic, and I can't recommend the Margaritas highly enough. Splurge a little and try some of the more expensive blends - seriously the best margaritas I've ever had.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Was a humid evening and we decided to sit on the patio. We were lucky to get the best seats on the patio, without any wait. That's surprising given how small the place is and that we had not made reservations. Each of us got a drink and we decided to try the home made salsa  and guacamole. \n",
      "\n",
      "We get our drinks and the apps and are having a good conversation. 5 minutes later, to our terrible luck, it starts pouring. We ask the server if he could move us to a table inside. The place is an converted home, so I'm worried we won't be seated for a while. Meanwhile, couple of my friends barely moved. Yes, the salsa was that good. Spectacular to say the least. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server moved us inside within 5 minutes and we didn't complain. We placed orders and the food took about 15-20 minutes. The server spoke highly of the baja fish tacos, but I was a little disappointed. I think it could have used some more flavor. The chicken tacos were surprisingly better. One of my friends got the huevos rancheros which was an enormous portion and was quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a great experience. Will definitely go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Having heard nothing but great things, and with my foodie boyfriend in town for only one more night, I knew this was our best bet for a date night. We called several times earlier in the day, but couldn't get through. After booking a reservation elsewhere, I called one last time. I was told they had 48 requests for reservations overnight and a table was unlikely. They sensed my disappointment and offered to wait list us and call if something came up. An hour later they called with availability for 2. Yesss!\n",
      "We arrived early and ordered a margarita while we waited for our table. The hostess recommended the Amber Margarita, it was a great choice If your looking to stick to the classics, not too sweet. One was enough. \n",
      "Now seated and keeping with our preference of asking waiters for recommendations, we ordered Guacamole Fresca and Ceviche of the Day (Marlin) as apps and Ancho Braised Brisket Tacos for him and Chile Rellenos for me. \n",
      "Our eyes were exceedingly bigger than our bellies. Next time we will share an entrée, or skip the apps altogether, but wanting to explore the menu as much as possible, we ordered and took a doggie bag for the next days lunch. \n",
      "The guacamole was good... fresh, flavorful and not too garlicky. The medium heat was more like mild, next time I'll give the hot a try. \n",
      "The ceviche was a little disappointing. Coming off a trip to San Francisco where I had excellent ceviche at Fresca for the first time, my standards were maybe a bit high. The blend was fresh and citrusy, with a great kick of heat. I would have preferred if the fish was more tender and not chopped into the same small cubes as everything else in the mix. Also, it might be because I got my tortilla fill on the guac, but I would have preferred the ceviche was served with plantain chips for variation. \n",
      "The tacos were some of the best I've had. Smokey and tender meat filled the flaky, soft shells. Served with their delicious seasoned rice, crema and salsa, it was the perfect Mexican meal. At least until we tried the oaxacan cheese stuffed rellenos. Breaded, fried, and placed on top of creamy tomato sauce, it was mouthwatering. With the rice, guac and salsa at its side, it was the perfect mix of flavours and textures. The only problem with this entree is that it made me regret ordering the apps because I could only have a few bites before feeling completely stuffed. \n",
      "I cannot wait to go back, intentionally order less, so I can fully enjoy my entire meal while it's hot and fresh. Service was good. The vibe is casual and cool, mixed with authentic Mexican decor.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for my sister's birthday with a group of her friends, note: this is not a place for large group (ie. anything more than 2 people).\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was good.  Fresh ingredients, good size portions, flavourful, simple and made with love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was attentive, polite and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a tequila bar, so don't expect a wide selection of scotch or vodka.  Their cocktails are creative and bring out the different tequila flavours. \n",
      "\n",
      "The space is where they lack and the \"intimate\" setting just gets annoying.   Because of proximity to everything else in the restaurant, it gets loud and it was hard to maneuver around especially since there was a group of us.  So if you're claustrophobic, wait till you get a seat on the patio. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, it's a bit pricey, but affordable considering the area.  It's about $8 for a plentiful side of guacamole and chips and $13 for tacos.  Which as I'll say again and again in my review of taco places- is too much for street food. \n",

I am not usually one to complain for small intimate restaurants, but this place is just too small for comfort.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

The menu is divided up into appetizers, tacos, burritos, and house specials, that includes entrees that don't fit into the other categories, such as huevos rancheros, tostadas, and carne asada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guacamole and nachos reminded me of Milagro, but with the option to add spice to it. Honestly though, I like Milagro's guac better, first because they give you a larger portion and second, at Playa Cabana I couldn't taste the other flavours in the guac too much, possibly because we ordered it spicy. The nachos were awesome though, and still warm from the oven (or more likely, the fryer).\n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered the chorizo sausage which was smothered in the best tasting sauce I've ever had.  The whole table was dipping their nachos in the sauce after the chorizo was done.  The sausage itself was pretty lean, and I'm a fan of fatty meat, but for a lean sausage, it was pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taco dishes come with three small tacos each for about $12. If you're hungry, get the rice and beans on the side for another $2.  The corn tortillas the tacos are made with is fresh and delicious, and the filling (I got skirt steak and chorizo) is okay. They did not disappoint me but did not stand out either.\n",

      "For dessert I had a spicy mole gelato that was absolutely delicious. It was rich and chocolatey with a tiny kick of spice at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "To drink, try the agave margarita.  It has orange and lime juice and no sugar, just agave nectar.  In my opinion, Playa Cabana's margaritas are perfectly made. They also have Jarritos pop and Mexican pop made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup - you actually CAN taste a difference!!\n",

The atmosphere is cozy, hip and modern Mexican, sometimes, it's nice being only six inches from your neighbouring table! And I'm glad we were able to sneak in, because everything was fabulous. \n",

      "We started off the meal with homemade chips and salsa. I wish there was an endless bowl of each for me to munch on all day and all night. The salsa was bright and fresh with just enough heat to slap your tongue around. The chips were warm and crisp and the perfect vehicle to get the salsa to your month. Next came the chicken tostadas and ancho braise short rib tacos. The chicken tostadas came piled hight with guac and crema with some black beans thrown into the mix to give the meal some weight. The surprise of the dish though, the rice! I chased down every single grain of rice that was on that plate. The short ribs had a delicious depth of flavour that was balance by the pico de gallo. \n",

I had the Chile Relleno which is one of my favorite Mexican dishes: fried pepper (with egg batter) with cheese and glorious filling inside. YUM!\n",

In the summer they have an awesome patio, which is always packed. Even though it's kinda small, the atmosphere is very intimate. Their mojito is one of the best in Toronto and they make it with either rum or tequila. I tried a tequila-based mojito and it was a little sour, but tasted pretty good. Their tacos are $13 for 3. They're tasty and well worth the trip. However, my #1 choice for tacos would still be Barrio Coreano located at 642 Bloor Street West. I give Playa Cabana a solid 4-star rating because they totally deserve it. Next time, I'll make sure to check out Playa Cabana Hacienda.\n",

The churros were good but I thought was over priced. Overall, loved Playa Cabana (especially in comparison to its sister Hacienda restaurant).\n",

      "I'm a serious Pho Lover, so when I heard about this place from the locals and saw the reviews, checking it out was a must. Ginger Gent and I ordered chicken and beef Pho ....to go in order to have date night by the fire. It such a wonderful surprise to get home and find the soup separated from the meat and noodles, which is ideal since you don't want your noodles super soggy. Needless to say the Pho was great and the smell is completely intoxicating.\n",

Pho Linh is a small vietnamese restaurant located at College and Dufferin; a little cluster of vietnamese shops and restaurants in the midst of the surrounding portuguese enclave. Recently renovated, Pho Linh delivers one of the better Pho's in downtown Toronto. It's money baby!\n",

      "Broth: lightly coloured, but sweet and rich in flavor. not overly salty, unlike other places in town. soup comes garnished with a healthy topping of scallions and cilantro always a pleasant sight to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noodles: slightly wider but I think it's because these are actually fresh rice noodles instead of the typical rice sticks used-they taste uberly fresh too. the only FRESH noodles I've come across amongst the pho joints downtown!\n",
      "\n",
      "Herb plate: saw and basil on hand; definite plus and lime wedge. more places should offer saw though not a dealbreaker for me so long as the broth is on point\n",

Unlike many other restos, there is a very generous amount of filling (ground pork and mushroom) in each roll and it's so flavourful! We also order the spring roll and bo kho (spicy stew beef) which wasn't spicy all. It had a very tasty broth that has been simmered with carrots and very very tender beef cubes. Just thinking about it makes it want to go back for another bowl tomorrow.\n",

      "Today I took it upon myself to try out this pho place as I've been to about 10 different places around Toronto. First off, don't come here with any vegetarians, as they have little to no selection for veggie pho. At most pho places I order the Rare beef \\/ beef ball rice noodle. It came very quick and I was so impressed with the noodle to meet ratio. I've been severely let down by most places around Toronto for this reason. Too much broth not enough good stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "The broth was delicious right to the end and the amount of meat was amazing. I'd say this is one of the better if not best pho places in Toronto. However two things threw me off (hence the not so perfect score) - There was not a mini dish to fill a little rooster sauce mix to dip the meat into, so I used one of the spoons. There was a fruit fly in the ice cold tea (since it's hot out now). Kinda a bummer, but the delicious pho stands true.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What the heck did I eat here? I'm drawing a blank on the viet name already, but it was S3 (special #3) which is only served on Monday-Thursday. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a stew with spicy broth, roasted carrots and big pieces of stewed beef. Noodles were thick. Beef and broth were delicious, a bit fatty but that's what makes it tasty. I didn't like the noodles\\/broth ratio, way too many noodles and not enough broth! mmm broth\n",

In short, get in and out, but definitely get in because if you really like Phó, the flavours are fantastic!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place pho is very good. Their pho broth is good. Price is inexpensive. The place is very small and loud. This is not a good place if you want to relax and enjoy your meal. When they are very busy, there will a line out the door. Avoid going in the weekends and lunch hours.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was probably my favourite pho place in Toronto as they use fresh noodle and ingredients.  The place seems like it had been undergone renovation recently so it looks more comfy dining in.  Their weekend special is bun bo hue which is always my favour.  But during my last visit I feel some components are missing such as coagulated pig blood and bun bo hue itself still tastes delicious but more of satay flavour.  I didn't taste much of shrimp paste in the soup as well.  The pho itself is still my favour in Toronto, the broth is light and perhaps not as flavourful as pho at Thinh Thanh, but they use flat rice noodle unlike many other places in Toronto that use dry vermicelli type.  Another item worth mentioning is pho bo kho, very very flavourful and yummy.  But they only serve that btw Mon-Thu.\n",

I wouldn't go out of my way to return as I do have other favourite pho places in the city however if I was in the area I definitely would stop by!\n",

Am really now realizing that it was crazy salty as I'm thirsty AF. But it was still pretty good. Would I go back? Sure, if I were in the area again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. 4\\/5\n"

And today I was craving a hot bowl of noodles so I decided to come here and see what my friends were talking about. My cousin and i came here around 4pm and already a lot of tables were occupied. We ended up getting a table by the window. I opened the menu and the first thing I saw was the bun bo hue (it's a weekend special fri-sun). So we ordered that plus the banh cuon. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the banh cuon arrived, I was so excited to try it. I've never had it before but it's like rice roll with pork. The rice roll itself is very thin and is sticky and when dipped into fish sauce...heaven! The bun bo hue tasted a bit different but in a good way. At other places it had too much of a lemongrass flavour to it. But this was different, there was a subtle taste of lemongrass plus other flavours. This was also spicy! I'm glad I tried this place out. I heard their other pho are amazing as well and I'd definitely come back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "They take cash* only!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's the best Pho restaurant in the area, so I highly recommend coming here if you're near. It's pretty small inside, so expect to wait for a table during prime eating hours. I believe they only accept cash. People come here because their food is of good value (tasty yet not too expensive). Their decor is nothing to write home about. I believe the restaurant is named after a Vietnamese singer, who happens to be the owner's sister. There is free parking on the surrounding side streets, or paid meter parking on College Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always order either the pho or banh cuon, or both!  Their bun bo hue is pretty OK.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My pho go to place. On weekends they have bun Bo hue which is my favourite. The servers are super friendly and I love their soup base. The place gets packed on weekends but the wait is fairly fast.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Though it was busy, we got there just in time to score a pair of seats.  The high turnover in customers meant we would have waited only a short while but who wants to wait when your hungry!\n",
      "There were two Pho places within spitting distance from each other.  The Phoenix was empty but Pho Lihn was packed.  Always go where the crowd goes - they must know something and with high turn over means fresh food...I hope!\n",
      "This has got to be one of the best Pho I've had.  The broth wasn't the MSG laden mixture that is sweet and salty at once and dries you up from the inside out.  The spring roll was pretty good but the cold roll left something to be desired.\n",
      "One note, the place kind of smelled and the cleanliness comes into question.  I did my best to sanitize my utensils before eating.  Oh well, with that many people eating there, I guess it was worth the risk!\n",
      "The service is brisk and efficient and we had a good night.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "3.5\\/5, +.5 for service\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to try Pho Linh after seeing the photos on Yelp and wanting to try the Banh Canh Cua...but it's only available Monday to Thursday! Since I went on a Friday I was a little taken aback...but decided to order the small house special noodle soup, and vow to myself I will return for a second visit regardless of this visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food came quite fast; about 4 minutes after I ordered. I liked the broth and the beef ingredients, but the noodles were a little overcooked and broke apart quite easily. They also use the slightly wider type of noodles, instead of the more narrow kinds you're used to in other Pho restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was excellent for a Vietnamese restaurant, and they actually said hello, thank you, and explained the fact they only had my original requested order from Mondays to Thursdays, and joked around with me saying I should come back on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heh. I'll keep this place in mind for sure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "We never would have tried Pho Linh based on its location and outside appearance -- a bit of a barren stretch on College before Dufferin, the sign reminds of those bad, small town diners that serve frozen fries and hockey puck burgers under guise of \"home cookin'\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, yelpers recommend it and we thought we'd take a break from Pho Phuong and try a new place.  It helps that it's equidistant from our house.\n",

      "Ambience is low key, very quiet, no multi-TV distraction (YAY!!!), and clean, though the menus were a bit skuzzy.  I blame the youth of today.\n",

      "As we were sitting down, another couple arrived to a chance meeting with apparent acquaintances who had been enjoying a meal:  \"You've got good taste in restaurants!\" they remarked to their friends.  \"This is the place for Pho in TO.\"  How's that for a first impression upon arriving? \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway!\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the S3 and #13, with a bean shake to wash it down.  The server informed that, due to Monday being a holiday (Easter weekend), S3 was unavailable -- he seemed somewhat chagrined, as though he was offending me.  No worries!  I got the Hue style beef pho instead, which is their weekend offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heather went for the ol' standby of noodles, grilled pork, and spring roll with salad (nice greens, no crappy\\/wilty iceberg lettuce!) and her customary avocado milkshake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soup was very good, tasty though not extraordinary, and came with nice, thick rice noodles rather than the vermicelli style one normally sees -- this pleased me greatly!  I definitely prefer a more robust noodle, so they score points here.  The side of sprouts, basil, limi, and a chili was very generous... which is good, because I usually have to ask for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The banh cuon (I think that's the name) isn't normally my style, but it was good.  The odd little muffin thing topped with a fried shimp was damned tasty (I didn't bother with the shrimp... it was desiccated, though had served its purpose by imparting mucho flavour).  \n",
      "\n",
      "I have come to realize, however, that I'm just not a fan of Vietnamese style sausage... at least not the spongy, starchy kind served here (and many other places).  They taste good, sure, but it just ain't meat.  I'd feel the same way if I was served a hotdog on the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heather remarked that her dinner was excellent, though she prefers the crispy spring rolls at Pho Phuong -- not because Pho Linh's are somehow lesser, oh no!  Linh's are huge, and crammed with meat.  So if you prefer a meaty roll, definitely try them out here... you won't be disappointed.     \n",
      "\n",
      "Shakes were both excellent, though they were served in plastic takeout cups when we were sitting down to eat (and it was pouring rain outside...).  Weird.  Ah well -- we'll ask for glass next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I've noticed a few people have questioned the service here.  We found it very fast, friendly, and good.  Absolutely no complaints there whatsoever.  Maybe it falters when it's busy... but it was A-OK this time around!\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all we were quite pleased with our experience -- I tried a couple things I wouldn't normally order, so won't pass judgement based on the things I didn't care for (the sausage, for example).  We'll definitely be back, in particular because I want to try their basic chicken pho.  If they roast their chicken and the broth is good I'll consider switching my go-to Pho joint!\n",

      "Let me tell you, when it comes to Vietnamese food I'm quite judgmental.  Not only is it my culture's food, but I have been surrounded by viet mothers who secretly cook competitively against each another my whole entire life. When I go out to have Vietnamese food, I don't expect a lot, I just expect it to be quick and tasty enough that I wouldn't pause and re think whether or not I want to take another bite.  I've heard a few things about pho linh and their infamous homemade banh pho. After having their bowl of pho, I can see what the rage is all about.  The banh pho is great, it tasted fresh and had the right amount of chewiness and matched perfectly well with the savory sweet soup. I also ordered the banh beo, which consists of small steamed rice cakes topped with chopped dried shrimp, scallions, mung bean paste, crispy fried shallots and nuoc mam (fish sauce). The texture of the banh beo was flawless, it wasn't soft and nor was it powdery (I've actually had banh beo made like this and it was not pleasant), I figured that if the banh pho was made well that the banh beo would come to par. Definitely a great Vietnamese establishment!\n",

      "This place makes a delicious pho. I ordered rare beef to go, and in typical fashion is was ready in under 5 minutes. Got it home, the broth was scalding hot still, so it perfectly cooked the beef. The noodles were the right texture, and the salad was fresh as can be, with no wilted brown tails on the bean sprouts. Really good flavour on the broth, although I agree with other posters that this is not one where the typical spices of anise and cardamom sing. Well rounded and meaty, it was still the perfect comfort food. I skipped my usual condiments doctoring, because it really didn't need it; the salt levels are bang on. While I didn't eat in, I did scope out the space. Not 100% clean, but not disturbingly dirty either. It had the sort of patina you'd expect from a place where customers are enthusiastically slurping down big bowls of soup. Will be back to try the bùn.\n",

And they had avocado shake which I love. There isn't much on service as this is very much a bare bones type of place. You even write down your own orders. And it's cash only.

They make it real good serving up big portions where they generously give larger fillings of minced pork and mushroom into each roll. This dish is very satisfying as it is cheap so it'll give you a run for your money! They also have a variety of genuine Vietnamese drinks that should be tried since you might not find them at any other Vietnamese restaurants such as che ba mau, suong sao etc. since the make time is a bit tedious. Spring rolls are also a must get appetizer as they are made crunchy with a delicious meat filling. My mouth is watering just talking about it.\n",

      "Although I find that the beef that they used were quite fatty, the speed of things that came after ordering was pretty fast. Bonus points for an impatient person like me! The weekday special beef stew is a must try as the broth is flavourful, deep and rich. Almost reminds me of an Ox Tail base soup.\n",

      "The Hue style rice cakes are also a must not miss dish. Its not often every Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto has this dish and does it well. This place is so affordable, fast and food is good.

The Nuoc Cham seems to be the Northern Vietnam variety - less garlicy and spicy than its southern counterpart.

The pho broth was a tad on the lighter side but very flavourful and the noodles are the smooth, 'fresh' type -- I'm used to the 'chewier', 'chalky' standard noodles -- but this was still very good.  The goi cuon is one of the better ones I've had.  And as expected, it was really cheap and the portions were big.\n",

Just remind yourself you're here for the food and NOT look around too much. I wanted to order the Bun Bo Hue but it's only available Friday to Sunday. I ended up ordering the Pho Bo Kho, a spicy beef stew noodle soup. Service was fast maybe because I was the only one there at 10 am. It came piping hot along with the requisite side of sprouts\\/herbs. The soup appeared oily but once you mix it around it's not that noticeable. But the taste was very flavorful. You know they took care & time to cook the broth down to this level of complexity. The rice noodles were the wide kind and soaked up the broth nicely. The beef brisket was a little gristly\\/fat but tender. I'm not a big fan of beef stew but this was damn amazing. I can't wait to come back for their Bun Bo Hue.\n",

The place didn't seem very clean and none of us at my table of five were very pleased with her food. We figured that since that been in business for a while they would have maybe perfected some of the beginning issues, but apparently they still hadn't gotten it right so we will not be returning or recommending this is a good restaurant as it would be a reflection on our taste.\n",

Two great young ladies, to handle a room or 24 people and they did it with a smile.   The food was delicious.  I ordered sushi, but also got to pick from the wife's plate of Stir Fry, and both were spot on. I am sure as we visit my sis more and more, we will make a point of visiting here often.\n",

      "When I got home, the pad thai portion was huge! I'm talking probably enough for 3 servings but the flavor really didn't sing to me. It tasted good but nothing special so I had to add a bunch of sriracha and black pepper.  The food is definitely not authentic and unmemorable  but decent if you want a quick fix.\n",

      "Kind of a hit or miss place.  I am tired of these 3 in 1 Asian places.  Thai, Japanese, and Chinese...these kind of places aren't authentic and are not great at any of these. I rather have just a straight Thai place or something.\n",

The pad thai is no where close to authentic. Singapore noodles are not authentic either, but still tastes really good. Large portions of every entree helps them with the star rating.\n",

No,  it was not music, it was the bartender a lady  that was being very loud with 2 patrons (or friends) for the entire duration of our dinner.  Not talking, but screaming and laughing loudly (around 8pm, so no alcohol induced).\n",

They were open til 10 so the decision was made. Our initial greeting by what looked to be the owner of all ppl was not one of excitement  or even welcome....but the service was friendly which I suppose is what matters. We had sushi to start with, because I am a weenie eater when it comes to sushi we had a California roll, which let's face it is hard to make wrong, and a Dragon roll, which was a hit with the rest of the table.  Our table ordered the Broccoli Beef and the Cashew Chicken both of which got middle of the road responses (we didn't take these leftovers home, which speaks volumes), we also had a simple Chicken Lo Mein which was delish (with the addition of some soy sauce) and the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken that was unique and very fresh.  Another big plus were the portion sizes, we all ordered individual dishes, but there was plenty to share, which is half the fun of dining out right?  \n",

      "My first experience here was poor as the wait was very long. In all fairness, they had only just opened and they were exceptionally busy and they did not have the staff to handle the demand. I went back - although I told myself I never would - as I really want this place to be good. My second visit was much better. Our server was very knowledgeable and professional and the food was good. I have updated my rating from one star to three as this represents an average of my two experiences. I'll likely go back but I'm not ready to recommend this place to out-of-town folks just yet!!!\n",

Was told 30-35 minute wait for a table when we got there.  25 minutes later we were seated.  Pleasantly surprised, as I had read negative reviews about longer than expected wait times.  We waited a little longer than normal for our waiter to come by, and by that time we had already looked over the menu and were ready to order, so he took our drink and food order at the same time.  Didn't have to wait too long on drinks.  Our food came out about 50 minutes after we'd been seated.  Nothing to write home about.  It wasn't horrible  but I've had better burgers.  It was an enjoyable lunch with friends I hadn't seen in a while, but next time we'll meet in the burbs with plenty of free parking.\n",

I saw about 4 or 5 tables that were not occupied. Why such a long wait when there appears to be open tables? Are they reserved? Do you not like the way I look? I wanted to ask, but I figured since a few friends are with me, I didn't want to make a scene. After about 30 minutes, we got seated. I ordered \"The Our Burger\". It had lettuce, tomato, onion, their signature wall sauce, and pickles. There wasn't too much sauce on my burger, which I appreciated. The sauce was flavorful and added a nice touch to the burger. I also ordered the Yukon gold fries, which were good. \n",

      "They have a bar area with several flat screen TVs and seating both inside and outside. The service was poor. It must have taken over 40 minutes to receive our food from the time we ordered. Once we finished, it took awhile to receive our checks. I do not think they were appropriately staffed with the amount of customers in the restaurant. There was a concert going on at the stadium nearby, so I don't think they were quite ready. The burger market is saturated, and although the wall sauce was good, it wasn't enough to really differentiate themselves from the other burger chains. There's only so many different ways you can make a burger.\n",

Not sure why they had an outside bar area and didnt think to put some fans out there for circulation jesus. Even the poor bartender was sweating bullets, her shirt literally soaked. She was nice through it all though, however, the way the bar is situated it had seats on the end near where the other waiters\\/waitresses do the checks and you can overhear the horrid conversations some of the staff have. For example, on this particular day, they were getting packed and this waitress with blonde hair and some tatts was blatantly saying \" i wish these f*king people would leave my table i cant deal with them anymore\" and then she started talking about her fellow employees to another employee and they were very rude and open about it.

The onion rings were the highlight, a single order is enough to feed two, and it comes with this awesome dipping sauce.

      "I was very happy when Cleveland finally got a Wahlburgers so I had high hopes going in.  My father and sister had just went here a couple weeks prior to my visit and had a wonderful visit and my Dad said his burger was the best he's ever had. We went on a Saturday early evening and we were seated right away. Our waiter Dwayne was the best part of our whole experience. He was very nice, fun, efficient and went above what most waiters do. Three of us ordered well done burgers and specifically asked that we did not want any pink whatsoever. When our burgers came out 2 of them were not only pink but had blood coming out. Our waiter was very upset by them also having one of the burgers wrongly ordered by having lettuce on it when asked without but also because 2\\/3 were pink and bloody. Management wanted to discount the burgers that we didn't even touch instead of taking them off the check completely which was a joke. What food establishment DISCOUNTS food you don't eat that THEY screw up instead of removing it from your check? We asked to speak to management and they sent out their little manager not the head honcho. The worker seemed a bit nervous and scared I'm not sure why but as if he would be in trouble even though it wasn't his fault. They need new chefs working there if they want some more business. Dwayne was an excellent waiter he was personable, kind and very apologetic even though it wasn't his fault but the chefs. Management did end up taking the burgers off the check but that was after us requesting to speak to him. I'm not completely sure I would go back after this experience if I do it would be because the staff made us feel at home not because of the cooking. Get some new cooks in the back who know how to cook up a burger and who can follow some simple directions. Don't let the Wahlburgers name go down in the dumps just because of some crappy chefs.\n",

      "The interior is bright. The indoor bar is large with plenty of tables to seat plenty of hungry individuals. The wait time when we went was no existent. Around the interior there are plenty of posters, all wahlburg branded of course. Movie posters for Mark, you know. It's right under the jack so you can either enter or exit right from an elevator straight from the jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that out of the way, let's speak on service and food. Our bartender was delightful. She understood the heat and gave us water without us even saying anything. She was thorough and attentive. Walburgers has a simple menu, not too large or small. This is a good thing. The negative is that fries are not a standard side. They make up by having large sides that you purchase separately that can be shared between two people. That's what my wife and I did. We ordered our 2 burgers and split their crispy onion rings, which were a HUGE helping for the price. Speaking on the onion \"rings\" they weren't rings, they were more like crispy shreds. They breading on them was delicious though. I'd never thought I'd like onion shreds outside of a burger but they were definitely done right. This is once again where the bartender came in and helped, we both ordered the onion rings, she quickly told us that we'd definitely only need one serving as it ended up being a large basket. I'd even say 3 people could share them if they get larger burgers. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the burgers themselves. They're definitely flavorful. I ordered the double decker. Which is a classic burger, the veggies were crisp and fresh, the bun was delicious. I haven't seen others reviews or why wahlburgers is getting a bad rap unless it's because of the outdoor bar. The food is good , I've had better burgers elsewhere, but these burgers definitely lived up to the hype.\n",

      "Seated with a larger group right away on a Saturday in a nice spot on their spacious patio. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the fiesta burger and it was delicious! Only complaint would be all the sauce is laid on the bottom bun, so the burger gets a little soggy and may fall apart. Our table also got onion straws\\/rings to share and they were incredible, gone in probably 5 min. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was excellent for everyone, HOWEVER, can't see myself wanting to go back due to service. Our waiter was awful. Silence when we ordered, never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. That was the most surprising. Wait for our food was pretty lengthy but not crazy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard the same thing over and over again about this place \"food is good, service is terrible\".\n"

      "Came in before the Indians\\/dodgers game. Seated right away outside and greeted by the server. Took our beverage orders and returned with them. We then placed our food order. The next time we had a table visit was almost 25 minutes later. Food almost took 45 minutes to come out. Got a total of 4 visits from the server including dropping the bill off. Maybe come back after they weed out some of the employees. Only nice part on this visit was the outdoor seating. That's why I'm giving this 3 stars.\n",

      "We ordered takeout from here and wasn't disappointed. They were very fast and friendly when we picked it up. My husband ordered sweet basil which could've used quite a bit more basil. I ordered spicy fried rice and it was very good. The prices we reasonable. Our bill was less than $20. This is definitely a family-owned restaurant which I really liked. They had a cute little bar in their with a great selection of Asian beers. Next time I go I will eat in so I can try some!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ordered (for delivery) chicken satay, tom yum soup and pad si-ew.  All of it are so delicious!  I would have given it 5 star but I asked for extra sauce on the pad si-ew but I didn't get it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "In any case I gave this place a 4\\/5 stars solely because of the Thai food they offered and customer service. Before I started plant based diet, I used to get their BBQ chickens. They were DELICIOUS! Also they have a tasty Thai tea here. It's very sweet though to if you are avoiding sugar it's probably not your thing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great food, good service, a little pricey but will definitely come back. Unlike other Thai joints, they actually check on you & refill your water here which is so nice! The 4 instead of 5 stars is because the waiter kept asking me if I was sure I wanted a spicy dish (I know, I know - I look too white to be able to handle spice but I love it!) and after I convinced him yes, the dish wasn't spicy at all and I HATE when they do that! I appreciate they're trying to protect me but they need to trust me when I order spicy. Food still had great flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My wife and I went to Bangkok Thai on a weekday afternoon, the place was quiet and low key. As we walked in, the hostess was very friendly. My wife had the Mighty Masaman Curry, and I had the spicy cat fish recommended by another yelper. Both dishes were delicious. The curry sauce was thick, creamy, coconutty and flavorful it went well with the potatoes and chicken. The cat fish was awesome, I'm not sure what the batter it was fried in was but I loved the fact that it wasn't greasy flavored or textured. The sauce that went with the cat fish was kinda sweet and a bit spicy depending on the level of spiciness you choose. We had coconut ice cream with fried bananas in a wonton as our dessert and those were pretty good too.\n",

      "\n",
      "OK, So since 1-1-2013 I went vegetarian and have been rating the places I like and cater to the vegetarian and vegan who wants good food and a place their meat eating friends can enjoy too. So I was in the mood for some Tom Kha soup and something I hadn't tried before. I ordered the Tom Kha, mild and wished I had gone for the medium...a little too westerned down for one who likes a little bite back. I also got the Buddhist Garden (which they do offer with meat as well or tofu)...very tasty! I am trying to figure out why the place was empty on a Saturday night...I'm figuring it's new and hasn't been discovered yet. But if you live on the west side and want some very good Thai this place delivers....just be prepared to pay $5.99 for that delivery...better to just go and pick it up...worth it too. Would have been 5 stars if the veges had been just a LITTLE LESS COOKED...NOT SOGGY BUT NOT QUITE CRISP AS I LIKE THEM.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This Thai Restaurant offers many items that I haven't seen before on Thai Menus. We started with curry puffs. They were crispy won ton skins stuffed with marinated seasoned minced chicken and sweet potatoes. They were tasty but didn't remind me of curry....just tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the chili eggplant with chicken. This dish was delicious! My chicken was tender and the sauce was bright, tasty and accented with lots of fresh herbs. For me it had all the right flavors going on. My husband had the sweet basil with beef. The beef was slightly chewy but the flavor of the sauce was good and this dish was infused with basil flavor like it should be. We both ordered our dishes HOT and they were perfect for us. Real pepper was used for heat and not powder like from some other Thai Restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Portions were good. I thought they were large for Thai.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have sticky rice and brown rice on the menu.\n",

We were surprised by excellent eggrolls and spring rolls very good Pad Thai and a beef dish with thick noodles and veggies or I don't recall the name. All the food was very savory and flavorful not sure about that earlier comment but ours was very good. We will definitely come back again!\n",
      "Don't let the outside ambiance fool you the food is excellent.\n",

      "Like another reviewer, I would have given them the full 5 stars, but they did the same thing to me with the tip.  Without asking she took the entire $6 as tip!!!  When she said \"thank you, Good Night,\" I realized that I wasn't getting any change.  \n",
      "Other than that, I recommend it.  Just tell them you want your change.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "I want here on a first date and the food was really good! I enjoyed my meal I got the Pad See Ew and my date really enjoyed his meal, it was some type of chicken curry dish. When we got there there was no one else in the restaurant, but the restaurant is decorated well and it has a very inviting environment. The service was good too, example; we never ran out of beverages (pet peeve of mine). On the subject of drinks, I really liked what ever brand\\/type of iced tea they service. Delicious!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "they have a chicken with lemon grass and coconut milk soup that I swear has crack in it because I can't get enough. I think it's the #18 or something. My girlfriend and I have cravings for it. It's so good, refreshing and just awesome. She loves the curry and some other dishes. The staff is friendly. Most of the time it's just us or maybe another couple in the restaurant and try the thai tea\n",

The sauce in my stir fry had just the right amount of spice and both the vegetables and chicken were cooked very well.  She was also a big fan of her curry.  We will definitely be coming back in the future, I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.\n"

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went to Bangkok and loved the papaya salad. It came out crisp and with just enough heat. their lunch fresh rolls and soup are a great free addition to their lunch menu. It was good because we petty much ate as soon as we sat down(perfect to get fed ASAP on a short lunch hour).  It looked pretty slow when we came in\\ but then again they likely just opened around 11 on a monday.Very reasonable lunch prices and dinner didn't look that much more. I have to come back on a weekend for dinner.\n",

      "The pineapple chicken curry was pretty good at a reasonable price.  I was disappointed that all of the other curries incorporate the exact same vegetables (including a poisonous plant called \"zucchini\"), but the pineapple curry uses a different mix.  The vegetables DID seem like they had been frozen, and there were no fresh herbs, so that's why I didn't give them the fifth star.  The punctuality, price, quantity and quality of meat, and overall flavor were quite favorable.  \n",

The Pad Thai seemed a little bland to me but my fiancé preferred it to others that he has had that had a little more sauce. \n",

Excited to share our meal \"family style\" we ordered some wonton soup and the fisherman's platter, thai iced teas, and the coconut pineapple fried rice-A MUST. In addition we ordered sweet and sour pork, pad thai- which is the best I've ever had, and a beef dish, blanking on the exact name.\n",

My wife ordered spicy noodle dish which she ordered \"medium\".  Both dishes tasted excellent and the spicy element was perfect for both of our dishes.  The portions sizes were fairly size able for the price of the entrees (~10 each) and I had enough for leftovers which is pretty rare for me especially since it was a late dinner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The one complaint I had was with the dessert. My wife loves sticky rice, especially when the mango is in season.  After we had returned our menus we decided to get the sticky rice without looking at the price when our server told my wife they did have mango available.  The dessert itself was not bad but I was taken aback when I saw the price being about 8 dollars.  Based on the portion size this was at best worth 5 and I felt lampooned but since I didn't check the price I just paid for the meal and hope I learned my lesson for next time.\n",

We've been going to another place off of bell and this place is a whole lot better. We're officially switching thai restaurants. The only thing is we like our food a little spicier so next to me we will ask. \n",

We got the spicy basil dish and the sweet and sour chicken. The spicy basil was amazing!!! You could actually taste the basil! It was delicious! On the downside, we got it at \"medium\" spicy level and it was just way too spicy. The sweet and sour chicken was ok. It could have been better. It wasn't very sweet, it was more sour. So I got a side of the sweet sauce and that made it better. \n",

The Red and Green Curries were delicious as was the Spicy noodles and Phad Thai.  Egg plant with chicken and basil beef also wonderful.  I was also surprised that there were not more people eating inside.  It's clean and the service was excellent.  I asked for peanut sauce and some extra hot spices to go  They mixed up the peanut sauce fresh at no charge.  Very accommodating.  I really liked the young couple that helped us.  If you like Thai better support this restaurant. Really enjoyed their food.\n",

      "We ordered Thai tea YUM! \n",
      "We ordered the spicy Shrimp soup for an appetizer. Then we waited. 10 -15 minutes later our soup was brought out. I liked it - but it was chicken not shrimp (that's one of the reasons I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars). Apparently the fiancee wasn't reading when I asked him if he wanted to try that soup, it has mushrooms and he hates mushrooms, but he said he wanted to try it. I thought it had good flavor. Watch out for the hard crunchy things (I think it was pieces of ginger) as they have a bite to them and are bitter.\n",
      "The waitress came to ask how our soup was and immediately appologized for the mistake of chicken instead of shrimp.\n",
      "She even had the cook make a small bowl of the shrimp soup for us.\n",
      "Our entress were brought out about 10 - 15 minutes later. I had the shrimp and pineapple curry. Yum! (not as good as Thai House but a close comparison, I'll ask for it to be a little spicer next time as I asked for mild).\n",
      "The fiancee order the cashew chicken YUM! the sauce was very good, not too salty. Lots of good sized cashews.\n",
      "We ordered fried rice to serve it over.\n",
      "Everything was very delicious.\n",
      "When we were almost finished the waitress came out with a bowl of coconut ice cream with chocolate drizzle. VERY YUM!! She said she was very sorry for the mix up with the soup and wanted us to try the ice cream. She said it is homemade with organic coconut milk.\n",

      "This place is pretty good! I've been here 4 or 5 times now at both lunch and dinner times. I'm not sure why there's never anyone else in here though. Maybe it's more of a pick up place. The servers are so sweet. Lunch specials are $6.99 and include soup and a fresh roll. Tons of vegetarian options - they do their tofu really well. I recommend the cashew nut with tofu. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm still trying to figure out their spice levels. Once I ordered spice level 5 and couldn't even eat the dish. During lunch they don't even ask your spice level preference and it comes with no spice at all.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ordered take out from here one evening when we didn't feel like cooking. As others have mentioned, don't let the outside stop you from trying this place. It's a generic looking strip mall, but inside this place is quite nice. We ordered online, using EatStreet (I believe), and when we arrived to pick up our order a very friendly woman helped us at the counter and our food was hot and ready to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters we had Chicken Satay and Crab Rangoons. The Crab Rangoons were what I expect, no complaints there. The Chicken Satay was really tasty - cooked properly and well seasoned; served with a nice peanut satay sauce (it's odd how this sauce differs from Thai restaurant to Thai restaurant, and Bangkok Thai's is a pretty good one).\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, my wife ordered The Queen's Fried Rice and I had the Spicy Noodle with chicken. The Queen's fried rice is filled with generous portions of chicken and shrimp and the rice was cooked nicely - soft and of a good consistency. Spicy Noodle is simple but filled with good flavors. Not very spicy in my opinion, but I eat a lot of hot food so I have a bias. I added some chili paste at home and went on happily.\n",

      "In regards to their dishes, amazing as well. I tried both the Pineapple Curry with Pork and Sweet Basil with Pork. The Pineapple curry was something I had never tried and would get again and again from now on however, the pineapple slices themselves were not the sweet focal point but rather the tomatoes which I loved. I don't even like tomatoes!\n",
      "The sweet basil I also had with pork and was also very good. I was worried when I ordered it that the basil flavor might be too strong or overpowered but it came out just right, very balanced.\n",

      "Maybe 4 stars is a little high, I would probably give three and a half if I could.  I came here for lunch and the plac was totally empty.  It's next to a charter school so there might be some kids outside smoking.  I guess it used to be a Mexican restaurant, and you can kind of tell inside from the mirrored arches.  I had the chicken curry lunch special version.  Comes with soup and a spring roll.  The portion of chicken curry was small, but for a lunch special it's not a bad deal- I think around $6.  The food itself was tasty and the service was good.  My water was always refilled.  The \"atmosphere\" of this place leaves a lot to be desired, but maybe if they get some more customers then they could eventually move to a nicer location.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I really like this place, I have tried several of the items off the menu , and they are all good, service has been very good, my only complaint is how cold it can be in there. One time i went there, I was happy to walk outside and warm up.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Getting beyond the emptiness of the place and the pop music. The red and yellow curry did not disappoint.\n",

      "Been a regular here...Food is good  ...Lunch menu is quite cheap but quantity was bit less !\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Before I begin my review, I wanted to say that this restaurant is actually located on 51st AVE and T-Bird inside the ACE hardware strip mall and NOT on Cactus.  I found this place through Yelp and here I was thinking it was on Cactus and I drove all up and down and sideways before pulling into a residential area and finding out its on T-Bird.  Needless to say, I was pissed at Yelp and Google maps for providing me with the wrong information and as of today, it is still showing this place on Cactus.\n",

      "On to the restaurant.... I was worried that this place wouldn't live up to my expectation of what quality Thai food should be and was I wrong!  I ordered their Pad Thai and it was everything a Pad Thai should be.  Next trip, I'm gonna try their other dishes and hopefully I will be as pleased.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "You see, young reader, the same derelict strip mall held a charter high school and a run down ACE Hardware. But those who could successfully navigate the cavernous parking lot and fight the Jack-in-the-Box monster were handsomely rewarded for their efforts. \n",

      "Yes, Thai Iced Tea so fantastical and Coconut Pineapple Rice and Chicken that could please the pickiest princess were housed within it's otherwise frightening walls. \n",

      "The homemade Coconut Iced Cream and Sweet Rice is worthy of its own fairy tale. Perfect was its flavor and consistency of texture. \n",

      "\n",
      "With this plate you also get Mi so soup and a small salad.  A bowl of white rice is also included with the meal as well.  They also offer specialty sushi plates, but can get add up if you really want plates of sushi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great offer is the happy hour Sunday-Thursday, 11am to 7pm.  You can get a bucket of bud, Bud light, Kirin, or Kirin light for $10.  Its 5 beers so 2 bucks a pop is not bad.  \n",

      "Lunch stop during the week, after Mani pedis next door.  Sushi bar meets sports bar!  Great lunch special selections but the selection of beers was equally as impressive.  TV screens abound, so to have a view from every seat.  The waitress was very knowledgeable as to the roll descriptions.  The pictures on the back wall, of all the celebrities and sports icons, were fun to peruse. I bet this place is hopping at night, being just south of the Arrowhead baseball compound and training center. \n",

      "I tried the crunch roll and the teriyaki beef roll. Both were amazing! I got it special ordered since I do not like avocado (not my fault, it's my brothers!) and they were very accommodating. Both were perfect and the portions were huge! I have leftovers (who would guess?) for tomorrow. Can't wait. :)\n",

      "I ordered 2 sets of the spicy yellowtail rolls, since that's my thang.  They came up quick, and they looked great... but that was nothing compared to their taste.  Probably one of the most spiciest spicy yellowtail rolls I've ever had.  A single tear of joy rolled off my cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "I offered one to my companion, who asserted that his sushi hymen was indeed intact.  After trying it, he blurted out complements regarding the bite sized treat... so I offered another.  But that's where my hospitality ended.  These were so good, that I bogarted 10 of the 12 rolls.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have rated this place before and I'm back to up them to 5 stars. My husband and I revisited tonight and we ordered the j-tom roll, crunch roll, and rock n roll. All three rolls were delicious this time unlike our last visit. We were extremely happy with our selection of rolls and I can say that I'm still in love with the rock n roll !\n",

      "This week we went with fellow sushi lovers and tried some super Delicious rolls  , loved the Pink Princess Roll ...it really is pink and tasty with pastel sauces laced over the top, also loved the dragon roll , a hot mess of tasty krab -like taste with other  sweet stuff that tasted good and memorable..sorry could not place the ingredients.  Daughter loved her pieces of magura, yellow tail and salmon , they looked clean and fresh.  We also had the Caterpiller , always a favorite. I can't wait to go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was my first time at this particular restaurant and since my friend was relatively unfamiliar with the sushi choices, I picked. I really wish I could remember the names of the things we had. They may come to me before I finish this review (\"Come onnnnnn Red Bull, kick in!). Whenever there's a non-sushi regular, one has to ease them in slowly via the mandatory introductory \"If you're going to actually like anything, it's probably this California Roll\" routine, avoiding squid and things that protrude out at one's face whenever possible. So, the California Roll, like Tennis in that it's easy to get but difficult to master, was actually exquisite! If I remember correctly, the next roll was a Dragon Roll of sorts with eel, cream cheese and some other seafood stuffs locked in there. Again, quite good. The last item was red and and came in an aluminum foil viking ship. It too was quite good. All in all, a nice evening with a good friend, sushi and yes, root beer (for me). I'd go here again for sure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great service and good food ! I ordered a glass of wine witch I didn't like and they gladly changed it for me and then i ordered a roll that I also didn't very like so they changed that for me too ! Thanks for the patience and kind service\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kabuki is never a disappointment.  Not for the half a dozen plus times I've gone there.  The service always comes with a smile.  Though I still consider myself a sushi-novice after a certain number of years, I like the adventure of trying new items on the menu.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am not a huge fan of Sushi but there were 5 of us and the other four (including one from Japan) really enjoyed everything.  We ordered several different Sushi rolls.  My favorite was the Beef Teriyaki and the Shrimp Tempura.  The others raved about the soft shell crab and the calimari.  Several of the rolls fell apart and since I am not experienced with chop sticks, I asked for a fork.  Almost done eating before the fork came but it was a very busy night and the service was fine otherwise.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had a Hawaii roll, with the best tuna! Very pleasantly surprised by our meal. All of our food was top notch. We always look forward to sushi because we don't get it very often... living in Northwest Iowa. We weren't disappointed with this spur of the moment decision.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Seems to be the best Sushi for the price that I have had here in Phoenix.  The restaurant itself is not so special, strip mall special, but the food and service were more than fine.  We had a native Japanese friend with us and she spoke favorably of the items she tried.\n"

      "Delicious! Ordered takeout for dinner last night. We ordered 3 rolls - Phoenix, Crunch and Dynamite. Both the Phoenix and Dynamite were amazing - loved the scallops on top of the Dynamite. The Crunch Roll wasn't as crunchy as I'd hoped, but I think that's because we refrigerated the rolls for a few hours before eating them. The hostess who helped me was very friendly. The cost came to about $40 with tip, which isn't terrible for the quality of the sushi. I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great place!  They didn't take reservations the night we were there, but hinted that if we came early they could seat us.  The wait was about 5 minutes less than what they quoted.  We enjoyed the food and our service, in spite of being seated next to the kitchen\\/door for the wait staff.\n",

      "i will go back, hopefully they remember the plates!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "As far as west valley sushi goes, this is one of the best I've had.  Nice display of major league athletic team stuff including a whole wall of photos of the staff with major league players who have visited the restaurant.  Our waitperson was delightful.  The Spicy Poke Salad was the best I've had since I left San Francisco.  We asked for it with tuna only.  I'd make the trip back just for this.  We managed to polish off a Philly Roll, and Tiger Roll and a Rainbow Roll with very little effort, but we waddled out when we left.  I've never had a Rainbow Roll that was totally wrapped in shrimp!!! FANTASTIC.  I would definitely go back; in fact this might be my new favorite sushi place.\n",

      "The food is superb. I absolutely love the \"Rock 'N Roll\" and their \"Vegas Roll\" is one to brag about. They have a pretty vast selection of saki and a full bar. \n",

      "The only thing I would not recommend here is their White Russian. Ick. Normally they don't come in such tall glasses, and this one is just overkill. Too much of a good thing is never a good thing.\n",

      "Love this place.  Great service.  Very clean.  The Phoenix roll is a must.  They usually have a couple games playing on TV.  My dad has taken his boss here, my grandma had her first sushi here...  in fact, I think I want to go tonight.  Yum.  Oh, I also think it is very affordable.  The fancy rolls are $13.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have tried many of their rolls and if this review was strictly based on the sushi I would give it a 3.5.  The sushi is exactly that.  It is just slightly above average.  The other .5 was added due to the service.  I have never received bad service here.  They are always fairly prompt and adequately friendly.  Decent sushi and good service.\n",

Everything was amazing!  We had fun mixing and matching.  My only issue was, the Lobster Roll didn't have any mention of a Dynamite Sauce on it in the menu, so I wasn't able to eat it (the reason for not giving 5 stars)...I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy things.  But, my friends enjoyed it.\n",

Great waitress, we got seated at the bar but she was very attentive. I love the menu with pictures of all the sushi and appetizers, make ordering so easy. The rolls was delicious and fresh salmon and tuna. Also free Edamame!!! Will definitely come back to try other rolls\n",

      "Pretty darn good!! Too early to give it 5 stars, but nothing to complain about. Good presentation, appeared relatively clean, no overpowering smells, and friendly looking staff. The staff appeared clean and happy to serve us. Food was not too pricey and was served in a timely fashion. I opted not to try the sushi this day because it's it's very consistent among the better local areas. We had the fire cracker app which was unique and AMAZING!! Definitely a must try if you've never had it! The entrees were awesome too! If the sushi is above par, then I will give it 5 stars.  It all comes down to the presentation and staff because most sushi places are falling behind in one or the other or both. I felt comfortable and important which made the overall experience very positive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has a nice lunch special. You get soup, salad and a three selection combination plate for about $13. I chose the teriyaki beef, combination tempura and California rolls. I couldn't finish my plate. The service was good and the atmosphere was fine for lunch.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My wife and I ate their for our weekly date night before going to see a movie.  Kabuki's happy hour is from 3-6pm, and offers a wide range of appetizers, salads, sushi and rolls to satisfy most people.  I'm definitely not a professional sea-food critic, but I've eaten at at least 6 different sushi places in valley.  Kabuki is one of my favorites thus far...especially for the price.  Vegas roll was awesome, and their Shrimp spring roll was very delicate, and tasted fresh.  The edamame appetizer for free was a nice touch as well.  I'd definitely recommend this place without hesitation.  Oh, and a 12oz draft of Sappporo for less than $2?  Pleasant surprise!\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The restaurant is located in a strip mall, but not strip mall quality food at all. The Phoenix and Dynamite rolls were both good. The menu tells you what is both inside and outside the roll so easy to choose menu items if you have dietary restrictions.\n",

Remember this was just the first visit so until I get in several visits and try more of the menu will I really know how much I like them. The star rating could go up or down. The service was great. The meal was about $2.00 more than I have been paying for something similar. It was better tasting. Fresh distinct tastes. I am looking forward to a repeat visit.\n",

I typically order the V6 which is vermicelli noodles with shrimp and egg roll plus your choice of pork, beef, or chicken.  I typically can't decide so I get beef and pork.  I had the calamari app this go around and was not a fan.  The platter app is good, 2 spring rolls, 2 egg rolls, and 2 coconut shrimps.  Great value and tons of good flavor.

      "This is my second time there in 2 weeks. Great steak pho, shrimp spring rolls and grilled beef w egg rolls on vermicelli. Great atmosphere at an excellent price! Where else can you get 2 entrees, appetizers and beverages for $25.  Food is fresh and tasty.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Looks like a new place - we had difficulty find it. Thanks to map quest we found it. Once inside u can really see the earthly balance in all the decor.. I got to say live the bar and variety of beers. Their egg rolls and pho delicious. Will definitely recommend and will definitely go back whenever i am close the community....\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "I would recommend this place to anyone who wants decent Vietnamese food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great little spot I found in Chandler, that serves very delicious pho of many sorts. This place is located about a mile south of the 202 on Gilbert Rd. I really like the setting and atmosphere they are going for here. Very quiet and peacful place to just get away and relax. I ordered the combination pho without the tendon. It was really good! I loved the textures of the different meats, and the broth was very very good! I was very please with the pho here. I will definietly be back to get it again. I noticed they had a few verieties of vietmenese coffees here. I think I am going to try one next time I visit.\n",

      "\n",
      "The only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 is they tend to be on the slower side considering their volume is less then other Vietnamese places we frequent. So... we just make sure we aren't in a hurry when we decide to go there.\n"

      "After traveling to Vietnam I'd say this is the best and most authentic Vietnamese food I've found in the east valley. Very fresh, extremely reasonable in price, and large portions. Clearly family run.  On this busy night every family member was hustling to give great service.  Very pretty and upscale on the inside with a full bar.  Worth the drive from NE Mesa.\n",

      "My boyfriend and I love stopping by this restaurant every time before I head out of state or just for dinner! our favorite is the N4. Bun bo hue. the broth is really something; fish sauce, crispy fried onion that adds to the aroma, taste and flavor. not to mention, lemongrass taste, and don't forget to add the vegetables, it helps give that crunch. other then that, service is on the slow side during week days, as oppose to weekend night's.\n",

Once you get inside it is quite pleasant with regular and bar style high tables which I like.  I had Spring Rolls and Chicken Pho, and both were very good.The Spring Rolls were ample size and the Pho filled me up as usual.  Would stop back again.\n",

      "Tried this place when they first opened and their pho was just okay. But went back for the first time in a long while, and the soup has improved a lot. Pricing is high compared to other Vietnamese places ($80 for four people?)but everything tasted good. Service was decent.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a fantastic place to grab a quick AND FILLING meal! Stopped by AZ Pho & Grill on my way home from work because I was really craving a Bahn Mi, and they did not disappoint! Because I had never been here (nor had I tried any Vietnamese restaurants since moving to AZ In march) I wanted to try their Pho as well. So I ordered the BBQ Pork Bahn Mi and the Brisket Pho (regular size) both to go. The service was really fast, I got my food piping hot within 10 minutes of ordering, and was out the door! I drove hope as quick as I could (carefully as not to spill the broth) and was pleasantly surprised that the Pho broth was still SUPER hot when I went to pour it into my bowl. \n",
      "\n",
      "The BBQ Pork Bahn Mi was a really tasty sandwich and something I could see myself ordering frequently. The bread was a little less crusty than I'm used to, but it was nice not to have it cut the roof of my mouth as I have with Bahn Mi sandwiches in the past. There was a really good amount of tender and flavorful pork on the sandwich and bonus points for NO weird chewy bits or extra fatty parts. My ONLY complaint with the sandwich is that the pickled veg on top was not sour enough, it was almost more like a sweet pickle, which combined with the sweet sauce they put under the pork (delicious by the way) was ALMOST too much sweetness. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Pho itself was really really flavorful. My wife said delightedly that \"it tastes like Christmas\" which was a complement especially since it was her first time ever trying Pho. The Brisket was really tender and full of intense Beef flavor, however next time I'd be interested to try something a little less intense in meaty flavor as I think it covered up some of the delicate flavor in the broth. \n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely loved that they send you home with all the accompaniments in separate containers so that you're able to add things based on your preferences. I ran out of cilantro and onion, but that's just because I like a bunch in my pho. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this is definitely going to make the rounds into our regularly visited restaurants, and I know I'm going to be back soon to fulfill another craving!\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Alright Pho, nothing that stands out.  Service is fine and the place is really clean.  The spring rolls are good and the kids always want an order of egg rolls.  They tried the calamari one time but they were not impressed.  Had the grilled meat and rice plate once.  I always love the Vietnamese grilled meats with the fish sauce.  I just wish the egg was fried with runny yolk.  Other Vietnamese restaurants have the runny yolk so I am spoiled.  When I am lazy and in the mood for Pho, we go here cause it is right down the street.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I usually end up at this restaurant when I am the mood for Vietnamese because it is my neighborhood joint. That said, I solidly believe this is one of best places to get pho and spring rolls. The broth and portion sizes of the beef soup are superior to restaurants in south Chandler.\n",
      "\n",
      "This restaurant is also 10x cleaner and more comfortable than a typical Vietnamese restaurant.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was very spot on.  Had the Pho Dac Biet and broth was very good. The rest of the dishes my family had wets very tasty as well.   They do not do refills and water was brought late to the end of the meal.\n",

      "Fresh ingredients, quick and friendly service, great location, what more can I ask for?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "First time in and we will be back.  Very nice space with attentive service.  Highly recommend the grilled beef rolls as a starter - delish and good portion.  I had the veggie Pho and added shrimp -  balanced light and fresh flavor.  Husband played it safe with beef fried rice (added and egg).  After the starter we brought food home for left overs.  Spied the bahn mi sandwiches and look forward to trying those on next visit.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "\n",
      "The rolls were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, without being oily or greasy. They are hands down the best I've had in all of Phoenix!!! The dipping sauce was thinner than I expected but full of great flavor! Sweet but not too sweet and the perfect compliment to the rolls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sandwiches were next, great value and great tasting both had tender meat and were also full of great flavors. The buns were a little too big. But overall no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pho was great, & aromatic. I could smell the cinnamon, cloves, anise a mile away! I was worried that the broth might actually be overpowering but it wasn't, the flavors were spot on and what I expect of a good pho.\n",

I have never had a pho with broth that I haven't had to add siracha, chili paste etc. The broth had a strong cinnamon taste and at first it was odd but once I added lime I found that the broth was perfectly balanced and satisfied all of my cravings.  Our service was a little spotty (they were very busy and didn't seem to be properly staffed)  otherwise this place easily deserves five stars. I can't wait to go back!\n",

I know most Viet places can be over the top but this place is spot on. Photographs very well chosen. Having been to Vietnam it brought back some fond memories. We came for lunch. Started with spring rolls which were fresh and delicious. The peanut sauce was phenomenal. Had vermicelli with grilled pork and \"noodle soup\" (hu tieu). Grilled pork was nice but the red pork in my hu tieu was dried. There aren't many options but the ones they have are good. The prices are a little high for Viet foods but I also come from a city where there are lots of Vietnamese places so I suppose when you're one in a few you can charge as much as you want. Our server was pleasant. I didn't catch her name but appreciate that the service gestures are there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "An eclectic, modern atmosphere and fresh, delicious ingredients make this pho experience definitely worth coming back again and again. I had the chicken pho with steamed vegetables added. It was amazing! Large portion sizes means you'll satisfy even the most ferocious appetite, or take it home as the leftovers are just as yummy. \n",

Their pork was dry and I didn't end up eating much of it. The rest of the dish was great! I love the fresh veggies - cucumbers, bean sprouts, lettuce, mint. My brother (tofu noodle dish) and mom (shrimp and egg roll noodle dish) also liked theirs. Thai iced tea was yummy and finished quickly! I'd come back!\n",

I waited 20 minutes for it to be made, the restaurant didn't look busy but theres \"Door Dash\" and \"Uber Eats\" now, so who knows, maybe they were busy with to-go\\/delivery orders.  \n",

      "This was my first time trying Pho so I really have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was great. I had the flank steak and my wife had the spicy seafood. I liked hers more, but mine was still good. This is a great place for first timers. Service was fast and friendly.  Restaurant was clean and modern. Manager checked in on us to see how everything was. You can tell that it is a well run restaurant and they take pride in what they do. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their menu.\n",

      "This was my first time here. So disclaimer first, pho is my single favorite stand alone dish. So my expectations are always pretty high when trying a new place. AZ Pho Grill did not disappoint! The base for a good pho is the broth, and their eye of round steak pho broth was probably one of the best broths I've ever had. And I've had A LOT of pho.  The balance ingredients in the bowl was pretty much perfect; not too much, not too little. But man oh man, that broth was good. I would have given five stars, but I can't because all I ate was the pho with a Thai tea. However, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!\n",

      "My god, this place is awesome.  As a grocery store, it's clean, has all your Korean needs and quite often there are samples being given out.  It's big, prices for the most part are fair and all prepared food reduces in price after 7:30pm (hot food, sushi, kimbap) yum.  The best part of this place is that it has a cafeteria that will make various Korean dishes for not nearly what they would charge you at a nice Korean restaurant and yet the dishes taste just as good or in some cases, even better.  The pork bone soup for example, this place has given me the tastiest one I have ever had so far and I've had quite a few now.  The make-your-own lunch isn't bad either except you have to be smart about what you want.  For example, me being not so smart I grabbed some macaroni salad, why that?  I have no idea.  This was a crappy macaroni salad and it was heavy so it just added weight to my dish and made it more expensive.... lame.  Luckily it was after 7:30pm so 50% off!!!!!  \n",
      "When buying food from the cafeteria, I highly suggest some of the combos.  One I've gotten before was $12 and I got a single serving of jajangmyun (which is gigantic and overfilled 2 of us) as well as some sweet and sour pork (deep fried and I would say more sweet than sour).  This meal alone will more than fill 2 of you and I've got to say, the jajangmyun is incredible.  My only regret is I wore a white shirt and sauce got on it.... it won't come off :(  The naengmyeon isn't bad either but you might as well just buy the packages and make it yourself..... other than the egg and cucumber and one slice of pork you get with it I'm convinced they are just using the package.  That being said, it's delicious especially on a hot day.\n",
      "Cheap Asian food is a weakness of mine and this place is making me fat.  Is it worth it though?  Absolutely.  Give it a try and if you can wait till after 7:30pm, I would say do it and eat like crazy!\n",

      "I like the fresh seafood better than the young location. Then have uni in the tray when it is in season.  As fresh or fresher than Dianna seafood.  Also the KOREAN  fried chicken is good.  Not as good as the fry (on tinge) but you can order in advance since it takes 30 minutes to prepare .\n",

      "What's not to like when you go shopping and you find something for FREE?  Yes, as I was perusing the meat section of this uber clean and nicely organized Korean food store, they had neatly wrapped packages of free  bones.  Bones are trendy and so, more expensive now and greatly appreciated by my dog Sailor (the one with the very large, sharp pointy white teeth.)

      "I enjoyed the custard korean japanese crispy waffle but did not like the green bean one. On monday, they have $4.99 for one lb of their lunch buffet, I got an arrangement of things like seaweed salad, potato salad, sweet & sour pork, sweet & sour chicken, and the Japchae. I enjoyed the potato salad and japchae most. My boyfriend got the pork bone soup. It was fall off the bone good. It was delicious! I also ordered the 6 piece sashimi for only $6.48 and the tuna kimbob. I recommend it all!! \n",

      "I have been a fan of the Galleria Super Market since they opened. The original spot was trend setting IMO for Korean Food focused super market. Alas I moved downtown and my trips have become few and far between to this gem of a  place. Next came their move to a new spot near steele to accommodate surprise surprise a condoplex. The new setup is confusing at best as it was not purpose built (old chapters building).\n",
      "So I had been itching to try out this branch ever since it opened. Finally I madeit  here today and its safe to say I like this spot better than the original flagship just because the layout alone makes a lot more sense. Location is more accessible if you are driving from downtown and there is a lot more to explore in this area as there are plenty of things in the same enclave. \n",
      "In terms of variety I think its about the same as the Thornhill branch. You get your specialized cuts of meat that are geared towards Korean Cuisine. I highly recommend the cuts of Kalbi from here as they sell some of the cuts I have rarely seen in a restaurant (Kalbi King Rib) let alone a grocery store. Then you have your kimchi filled refrigeration area, sauce mixes etc etc.  \n",
      "Plenty of other knick knacks are also there which go well with beer or with mains. \n",
      "There is a food court here as well though I didn't get a chance to explore it much but it looked interesting. \n",
      "A good addition to the ever growing ethnic focused grocery stores.\n",

      "I love Galleria Supermarket.  It's like a Korean Loblaws!  I used to go to the one on Yonge and Steeles, but now that they moved to a different location (still at Yonge and Steeles, but a different physical space), it's not that easy to access from the street, so I like this one on York Mills better!  FYI: the York Mills location is not open 24 hours, it closes at midnight.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, this location has a by-the-weight buffet.  The buffet is awesome.  It's $4.99 a pound, and there is a good selection.  Last time I was there they had bulgogi (I think they always have this), a spicy battered chicken (similar to General Tao chicken, but Korean instead of Chinese), chicken wings, meatballs, noodles, rice, tofu and so much more.  The food was delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is very clean and the lighting very bright.  I like this kind of shopping environment!  When I was there, they had lots of \"sampling stations\" where employees were giving samples of items that were on promotion.  Some of the things they were giving out were dumplings, rice cakes, ramen, and kimchi.  All the employees giving out the samples were wearing face shields and gloves.  Some people may think \"science fiction movie,\" but I think \"good sanitation!\"  I value cleanliness, so this scores big points with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will admit that I come here mainly for the prepared foods and ramen.  They have an excellent selection of both.  They also have lots of ingredients for you to make your own Korean food from scratch, but alas I haven't the foggiest when it comes to that, so I just stick with the ready-to-eat items.      \n",

      "Cons:\n",
      "Food court not as good as other Galleria\n",
      "Not open 24 hours\n",

      "This review will be more of a comparison to the other Galleria than anything.  Both Galleria's are pretty great, don't get me wrong.  I just like the Yonge and Steeles location a little better for the upcoming reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "First the good things.  I find this Galleria has a lot more selection than the one at Yonge and Steeles.  There were products here that I don't see at that location.  It feels like this location is also larger and able to carry more items.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The parking here is also tremendously better than the other location.  They have a humongous parking lot in the back of the plaza it is located in.  You don't think there would be this many spots looking in from the street.  This is great because this location shares the plaza with a lot of other places so you do need parking to be ample.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the things I don't like as much.  The food court was a little disappointing to me unfortunately.  The other location has 4 different stalls to choose from.  Each stall has different types of cuisine.  This place only has the one stall, albeit a really big one.  The seating is also not as good.  There are bar like seats situated around the stall which is great if you're eating alone.  If you come as a family, you have about 10-15 tables to choose from at that's it. I came for mama's chicken and quite frankly, you can do better for Korean fried chicken.  It's good, but didn't match the hype.  Home of Hot Taste blows it out of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, this location is not open 24 hours.  I have stated the convenience of having a supermarket available at all times during the day.  Most of the Korean supermarkets I find are open 24 hours so it's strange not to see this one as well.  I'm thinking it's about the location more than anything.\n",

The  noodles in black sauce (can't write the name in English) are disappointing here because the noodles taste like spaghetti and not the traditional noodles. The sweet and sour pork type dish is delicious and fresh and the soft tofu in spicy soup is delicious, but has more of a seafood profile than other ones I've had. \n",

It was so good that we had to come back the next day to try other dishes. Almost everything (see pictures) we had was very tasty considering that it is a food court. My favorite was the pork bone soup, The only let down was the naengmyun, which seemed subpar. We also introduced this place to our uncle, and now he stops by regularly to eat.\n",

      "The cafeteria is a bit hit and miss. Some good menu items like the pork bone soup (flavorful and tender pork), and then some outright terrible ones like the Korean traditional noodles (bland noodles in a bland kimchi broth). Service is generally good, though brusque at times. Solid experience, all in all. \n",

      "Great Korean supermarket that we happened to discover by way of chance. The selection of all Asian type food is outstanding. However the real deal with this place is the restaurant and all the prepared foods. It is out of this world amazing. Selection is huge and food looks and tastes fresh. Everything is available from your Korean fried chicken to noodles, different Korean dishes and also of course sushi\\/sashimi. I did notice some of the grocery items a bit more expensive than other Asian marts I've been to but prices are only a tad higher. If I lived nearby with the busy lifestyle I have I'd frequent Galleria weekly. Asian food is comfort food for me and it's plentiful and delicious looking. Yeah folks come try some out.\n",

      "As a Korean living in the area, I feel my Yelp account would not be complete without a review of Galleria Supermarket. From the moment it was rumored Galleria Supermarket would be coming to my hood, I was counting down the days. I kid you not, I even got \"insider updates\" through friends and family, on how soon it would be opening, and how big it was going to be. Unfortunately I had to work on opening day so I wasn't able to witness history in the making, but I did go the next day, and the next, and the next. In fact, i just came back from Galleria right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "The supermarket itself is very well organized, bright, well maintained and always clean. The service is also very great, lots of friendly ahjumas, ajusshis and Korean college students to help the lost ones. Koreans are generally always in a rush so the service is always quick as well.  The food is very clean and so are the products. Their banchans are good though not as good as some of the ones from the smaller stores down at Bloor & Christie (Korean Town).  Oh and the Bakery is also quite the improvement form the old location in terms of taste and selection. The Sweet Potato Bun, the Peanut Cream Bun, the Custard Bun, all yummy, even the cakes and the rolls taste better. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have AMAZING fried chicken smothered in sweet and spicy sauce, which is worth a try. In fact I'm craving it right now... They also have a really great Lunch and Dinner Buffet, and the prices are extremely reasonable, even if its NOT all you can eat.\n",

      "After 8 or 9PM, many of their baked goods, and other ready-to-eat food items go on sale for 15-50% off... which is super awesome because\n",

      "A) It's cheap...!!! Buy moreee!! \n",
      "B) It assures me that they only sell fresh items :)\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside:\n",
      "Considering the big location, they don't have as much selection as one might expect. I know, it sounds crazy, but unless you're a pro Korean grocery shopper, that goes in knowing exactly what you're looking for, you wouldn't notice. That said, when it comes to Korean tea, drinks and snacks, I know my stuff. The relatively tiny Hmart down in the North York Area carries more variety when it comes to snacks, probably due to the large population of Korean exchange students in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Galleria Supermarket, I would really like to give you 5 stars but until you up your game with more product variety, I can only give you 4 :(\n",

      "It's hard to imagine that food court food could taste very good but at this one supermarket in North York, they certainly defied the odds and presented some of the best foods one could imagine coming out of a food court. Galleria Supermarket is located in the east end of North York and predominately sells and produces some of the most popular Korean products and foods.  I have eaten at the food court numerous times and each time I would order something different.  On a very recent occasion, I went over there for lunch and tried out their Pork Neck Bone Stew with Noodles.  ($7.49)\n",
      "\n",
      "Made freshly on the spot, about five large pieces of pork neck bones with meat on them were mixed with a large piece of potato, glass noodles, vegetables, green onions and what seemed like chili seeds.  All of this was cooked in a hot, spicy broth which I would say had quite the kick to it.  Even though the picture didn't do it a whole lot of justice, there was quite a lot of food in this one bowl.  The combo also came with a bowl of spicy turnips and a bowl of rice.  For the price one paid, one was certainly getting their money's worth. The pork meat was delicious although mind you there was obvious more bone than meat.  On a scale of one to ten, I would put the spicy level at a 6 for this bowl.  It had a pretty good kick to it but I was still able to stomach it pretty good. There were also about two wads of glass noodles on the bottom of the bowl just to give you an idea as to how much food was in this one bowl.  All of it was presented in a very hot ceramic black bowl which kept the food sizzling when it came out of the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a great lunch meal to have.  One bowl of rice and half a bowl of glass noodles really filled one up and when I was done, I left there super satisfied and very happy with my purchase.  If one does not like noodles, they also have a 50-item display where people can pick and choose a mixture of items from that display.  They also have pre-made sushi and there is also a bakery there.  Certainly lots to choose from and all made to taste just like it was from Korea.  If you have not been there before, certainly give it a try.  It sure is quite different than some of the other supermarket food courts in terms of selection and variety.\n",

They also have one of the freshest sashimi sold at 20% off if you go after 8pm. I usually come here only for the quick eats because their regular grocery items are pretty pricey. Plenty of parking and the best part is that it opens till 11pm.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went to try Mom's Korean Fried Chicken and remembered how good KFC can be when you dont try to take it home with you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoyed and will be back if in area.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Huge Korean grocery selection, ok prices, and a large and bright space. Love it!  Also with free wifi. At the entrance you're greeted with a life-size cutout of PSY promoting Shin Ramyon (didn't make me buy any, but I did end up youtube-ing the ad...on the free wifi). \n",
      "\n",
      "Parking is easy to find on weekend mornings, especially compared to other nearby Asian shops at Sunny or Peanut Plaza. And definitely compared to T&T. Pretty calm shopping experience as far as Asian markets go. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the usual grocery selection (fresh, dried, frozen), there is a bakery, and several prepared food stations. Built in to one of the surrounding walls are little kiosks including a clock shop, cosmetics\\/skincare shop and a travel agency....just in case you need one of those.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite section? The ice cream aisle! ...with those Melona ice cream bars I love so much. Don't get sucked in by the Melona fish-shaped ice waffles, I know they're cute, but get the melon bars instead ok? They're better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is the newer bigger version of Galleria and has a much bigger parking lot than the one on Yonge street.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While this is on the pricier side of Asian grocery stores, this place is much cleaner and very well organized.  In addition, fruits and vegetables look much fresher than T&T. Their Korean side dish section is also huge and you can buy certain dishes at 4 for $9.99 or 3 for 9.99 (these ones are bigger). \n",
      "\n",
      "They also have a big food court\\/dining\\/baked good areas which is kept clean as well and has your few Korean staple foods such as PBS, Soon Tofu and KFC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: Great change of pace from Foody Mart, T&T and a much more enjoyable shopping experience if you're willing to pay a bit of a premium.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Galleria is a regular on my shopping circuit for the simple fact that my fiancee is Korea, I mean straight out of Seoul Korean (not Compton). \n",
      "\n",
      "Everytime we go to Galleria my fiancee buys lots of meats, vegetables and sauces so I am assuming the market carries all of the Korean essentials. We are comparing it to the supermarket in the Koreatown downtown so it seems so big. We don't have experience going to the older one as we are new to Toronto. So on the Fiancee side BIG UPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the picky white guys opinion which probably doesn't count for too much considering this place caters to the Korean pallet. I prefer the Kimchi at the supermarket downtown. I find the kimchi at Galleria to be too hot\\/spicy. Second the supermarket downtown in Christie carries a larger variety of Energy Drinks (also my favorite one from Japan) and Japanese snacks so I like to visit there. I only comment on this as me and my fiancee lived in Tokyo for 7 years so it is nice to be able to pick up a few of our favorite Japanese items while grabbing \"her\" Korean essentials. Yes that's right I said it, I did it, \"her\" Korean essentials. Just wish the Japanese stuff wasn't so overpriced!\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Note - if you are new to Toronto and love Korean food, Galleria is definitely the place to go in the North York area.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went here around 11pm on a Thursday to look for Shiseido conditioner as T&T was closed at Cherry St. I didn't find it here, but I found bone marrow for soup and UNI (sea urchin). Forever I've been trying to catch some at Diana's Seafood (pun intended) with no luck. I am going straight home and boiling rice to eat it with. This place is bulgogi and kalbi meat heaven, but I wish I found some pre-marinated. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and service was very friendly as well!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has the most selection of Korean products! Their produce is a bit expensive.  They're pre-made bentos and sushi are great and especially affordable when they go on sale in the evening!  Sometimes you can catch the guy at the corner making fresh taiyaki red bean cake.  They also have a food court with menu prices similar to sit in restaurants so I rather do that.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I come here pretty often with my mom to eat and buy some groceries. We like to buy the apples, sweet potatoes (huge bag, usually on sale), ginger (fresher than Chinese supermarkets), Korean cold noodles + soup (from frozen aisle), lettuce (for kimchi) and so on. The items are usually really fresh, some can be quite pricey so it depends on what you buy here. They have a lot of things not limited to food such as kitchenware, slippers, hair dye, skincare, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to the food section, there is a a food court area and bakery inside. They sometimes have the pork bone soup as their daily special for a good deal. The pork bone soup here is good. The meat is very tender! Although it tends to be on the saltier end. You order the food and receive an electronic device that beeps when your food is ready and you go pick it up. They also have prepackaged meals like kimbap, sushi, bentos, and such. Or they have self-serve dishes that they charge by weight. There is also a fried chicken area specifically for ordering Korean fried chicken. I usually get the bibimbap, you can choose between the hot stone or regular (basically cold but you get a bowl of warm rice). Hot stone is like a two difference or something. They recently changed up the side dishes so that it is self-serve, you have the kimchi radish and bean sprouts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the bakery, I am a huge fan of cream. They sell different types of cream bread here so yes I am in heaven haha. I am a matcha fan so I like the matcha one, particularly the one with a layer of cake in it. It is a bit more on the pricey end depending on what type you get but it is a nice treat. They also sell cakes and bingsoo which I haven't tried. And lastly near the checkout of galleria, there is an area that sells taiyaki. I've tried it before and it is so good when freshly made ahh. Buttery goodness haha. Oh and they sell walnut cakes here (cake shaped like a walnut with walnut and red bean filling, pretty good).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I love Korean food and the culture so I come back pretty frequently. In general the quality has been quite consistent. I highly recommend coming here. They have like a 10% discount for workers on Wednesdays which is good if you work nearby. They have a such a huge variety of meals to choose from after all. Or of you want a quick cheap meal just get the regular kimbap for $3.99!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What can i say? They serve sea urchin and other sashimi lunchbox for an affordable price.  my stomach hasnt been that happy for a while.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a Korean supermarket that I frequent often since I live in the area. I typically go to just pick up their cooked foods and sushi when I am too lazy to cook. The sushi is fresh and there is variety. They got sashimi, sushi and maki combos that are at discount after 7PM. The cooked foods include gimbap, fried chicken, kimchi fried rice, steamed and fried pork vegetable dumplings, mungbean pancakes, Korean soups - the list continues. You'll have to go and see what is available that day. Definitely check out this grocery store whenever you're in the area! Oh and they got a points card. Make sure to subscribe!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I get  groceries and prepared foods here, no problem, and there's lots of parking.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love going grocery shopping here! It's clean, bright, they have a great selection of everything...like tofu? They make it fresh here along with soybean milk.  How about mushrooms? I specifically go here to pick up Ontario-grown shiitake and enoki. If you get hungry while shopping, no probs you can grab some food from their cooking station and eat it in their food court. I'm liking their kampppongi and KFC so far... will try more on my next visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh yeah, tip I picked up from a friend... Get their free Galleria card and you'll get a 10% discount!\n"

      "Good supermarket. Various kinds of Korean products and prepared food can be found in this market. Prices are reasonable, especially those store-made food, much cheaper than some Korean restaurants but really delicious. It also provides some public seats for little restaurants inside the market to make customers dinning conveniently.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They have quality produce here for the same or decent price compared to other Chinese grocers (i.e. their pork bones are meatier, pork belly is fattier).\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This Korean Galleria is better then its other location (on steeles) in my opinion. It has a fresh variety of Korean Food delights. In particular, try out their fresh Sashimi and Sushi prepared foods. If you go after 7 pm, it is marked down 30-40% everyday. You can also go to their food court area and pick up precooked food options such as Bulgogi, Korean Glass Noodles, Kimchi etc. \n",

      "\n",
      "After walking around the open kitchen a couple of times I finally asked and was directed to a cashier specifically set up to take orders. I placed my order for a Pork Neck Bone Soup and was handed a numbered buzzer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order took about 15 minutes to prepare and I didn't mind the wait because with every minute I waited I knew another minute of love was put into the dish I was about to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my buzzer went off I nearly knocked over my chair and ran over to the pickup area. The soup was bubbling and inside sat 4 meaty bones in a clear and fatty broth. It came with a side of 2 banchan and some purple sticky rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meat was delicious and while the broth was hearty as well it wasn't as spicy as I tend to like but this was likely personal preference for me, I think. Overall the dish totally delivered... and may I remind you, this was in a GROCERY Store no less!\n",
      "\n",

      "Came for dinner tonight. Galleria is my go-to place to grab food when no one at home wants to cook). \n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to try their Asian Food Festival combo for 2 ($11.5\\/person = $23 before tax). This included 1\\/2 an Original Fried Chicken (Mom's Chicken), a Korean Style Noodle with Black Bean Sauce (Jajangmyun), and a Stir Fried Rice and Vegetables (aka vegetable fried rice) with black bean sauce). \n",
      "\n",
      "For a combo for 2, it was a lot of food. My parents I shared it and had leftovers to take home (my dad was headed to play badminton, so he didn't fill up. Had he, this combo for 2 would have been the perfect amount of food for the three of us). The rice and the noodles were both fresh. We sat at the bar surrounding their food prep station and watched them make our dinner! I love doing that. The chicken could have been fresh (they do it to order), but we were in a rush, and asked if we could just get a 1\\/2 chicken order from their grab-and-go station, and they were willing to let us do that. I greatly appreciated that, especially as the cashier had to run around for a bit to make sure that it was okay. Even after we got our food, service was very friendly. We asked for bowls and takeout containers and were given them with a smile even though the meal prep people were very busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We finished dinner just in time to get to their 7:30pm end-of-day sales! I ended up taking home a container of dukbokki (stir fried rice cakes with spicy sauce) for $3.49, a dish of fried zucchini for $2.79, a container of spicy fried tofu for $2.00, a container of soondae (Korean blood sausage) for $3.84, and a container of pork bone soup for $3.84. These are the prices after they had each been marked down between 30% and 50% off! Yeah. I like my discount end-of-day food. Now I won't have to cook lunch tomorrow! Hurray for Galleria!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh. I also got a 25pk of yakult for $3.78. I'm trying to drink one right now. It's frozen...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This review is regarding the food in the food court.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably my go to place for Korean food. The prices are very reasonable and there's lots to choose from! You can order things from the menu, buy pre-made food (ex. Bimbap, Korean fried chicken, etc.) and also buy food by pound (like buffet). My favourite here is the \"jajiang mein\" (black bean sauce with noodles). \n",
      "\n",

      "I know the other one located in North York, but I think this one is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered Gamja Tang, kind of spicy Pork bones soup with potatoes. It was good. One of the best I had for a while. And the best part, it was cheap. Made my day.\n",

      "\n",
      "The special thing of the supermarket is there's a cafeteria area inside. If you are rushed for you lunch, you can picked up some ready-made dishes for your lunchbox. Some dishes are as good as regular Korean restaurants. Don't forget the steamed rice, it always goes with Korean dishes if you want to try the food in a more Korean manner. This more buffet-like way, I think, it's really a fast way to get your stomach filled nicely. \n",

      "You can also order the food from menu. And it won't make you wait for too long. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Galleria has everything!   Fresh fruits and vegetables, lots of meats, and a plentiful variety of cooked foods.  You need beauty products?  Check.  How about a kimchi fridge?  Check.  U need a fishing outfit?  They have that too.  It's like one stop shopping.  They have great sampling stations, even a few on weekdays.  Psy is on repeat, playing in the background.\n",

      "This is not the store you can come in and just pick up one thing. Unless I stay focused, I usually am distracted with all the good food. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing for sure, is that the place is clean and neat. All the produce is stocked like someone with OCD had to do it. \n",
      "Although a lot of the Asian produce is being sold here, remember this is a Korean supermarket. Bean sprouts and cabbage is cheap, but other chinese veggies may not be. \n",
      "Apples are quite expensive at least $1.50\\/lb. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're also looking for Asian snacks, you can find Japanese and Korean nibbles here, but chinese ones are hard to find. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was also looking for chicken today, but unless I got an organic whole chicken, it was of no avail. They have lots of beef short ribs (yum hard to resist) either marinated ($23+) or not ($18+), and pork. \n",

      "Galleria is Korea's answer to T&T's. This location is huge!! You can find so many interesting grocery items here... from their in-house made kimchi and tofu, to kalbi beef, to different kinds of teas (including the 'ballerina tea' to apparently cause weight loss:S), all kinds of dumplings, and fun snacks. It is quite organized, clean, and super air-conditioned (I visited on a hot summer day). In addition to groceries, you can find beauty products like sheet masks and there is even a travel agency! Oh, and they sell Kimchi fridges! Yes, that is a thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "As others have mentioned, order the fried chicken so that you can shop and by the time you are done it will be ready! (They give you a buzzer so you can wander around and it will go off when your chicken is ready). The chicken is really messy to eat because it is covered in a sticky, sweet and spicy sauce. But it is sooo crispy and delicious!! You can buy side dishes to go with it. I'm partial to the kimbap rolls. There is a food court style seating area. \n",

Anyway, me and my wife like coming here on weekdays, weekends are really busy, this is a very popular place. Love the omelets, and pancakes are very good. Great staff {5-Stars} If you have coffee, they bring you your own pot, nice touch!  Now I am a picky eater, so the one thing I don't care for are the potatoes that come as a side with most breakfast orders. They are mushy, not really crisp, not my style, not seasoned, just plain. One more thing, is the seating. There is no soft seats in this place. All booths are wooden benches. If you have back issues like me, then a long time here on your behind, might cause a bit of pain in ye'ol back. That being said, of course I will be back!!!!! another plus to this place is they have a stamp card, and every meal you purchase, you get a stamp. After 7 stamps you get a free meal, and ion Mondays, you get 2 stamps per meal, this is a great deal!! So i have to give a big Woo Hoo!!!!!\n",

It's OK because I stole bread off my boyfriends' plate and gave him one of my HUGE biscuits\\/gravy,lol.  The meal was still delicious. We got a side of bacon.  The bacon is thick, long, and extra salty.  Think beef jerky.  My boyfriend loved it and I didn't.  I think next time, I will ask for the bacon not to be cooked well done.\n",

I thought the waiter's happiness level was appropriate (I don't need coffee to wake up) and he made sure to check in regularly.  I thought the staff went out of their way to make sure everyone was happily satisfied.  I watched them and they seemed to be quick to make sure turnover kept the wait reasonable.  \n",

      "Before I became gluten free my favorite thing to get was the banana chocolate chip pancakes. They are huge, enough to feed three people! The bacon is also delicious and the orange juice tastes very fresh. After I discovered I had a gluten allergy I was disappointed to find out I was much more limited. Even the appearing innocent bacon and scrambled eggs had gluten (from the egg substitute) so there is not nearly as much to enjoy here if you are gluten intolerant. If you are gluten free and looking for some good breakfast places check some of my other reviews\n",

The establishment is clean, wait times even during their busier times aren't painful (15 minutes or so).  The tables are consistently set and clean.  The bathroom as well, while small in size, is cleanly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has a variety, but not an overwhelming amount of options.  That is a good thing.  There's something for everyone, don't get me wrong.  Now as far as your options go you can expect your garden variety breakfast items to choose from.  The coffee is good as is.  I'm a fan of them leaving the pitcher of water and coffee pot at the table.  The food is good, not great, but good.  They have a cinnamon roll here that's the size of a dinner plate.  I love cinnamon rolls, but not the biggest fan of theirs.  It has the taste and consistently of a yeasty dinner roll, with some cinnamon and sugar, slathered in icing.  If that's more your style, by all means try it.  It wasn't bad, just not my favorite.  \n",

Now really my only complaint is the three pages of rules that govern their frequent diners card. Every other place I eat at often you get a stamp per entree you purchase, and you can combine cards. The Good Egg is a little more picky, and only gives one stamp per visit, and you cannot combine cards.\n",

I had the catfish sandwich. Catfish being the special at the time. I think they specialise in bottom feeder (cheaper) fish, but do it well! The catfish definitely had some seasoning to it. I also dared to try some of their BBQ sauce on it. And I liked it... The sauce was sweet and spicy.\n",

We only had room for something small, so we decided to share an order of Arctic Char fish tacos. Each of the four tacos was filled with two chunky pieces of fish that was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection, along with some lettuce and red onions. (It was our first time trying Arctic Char, and we both felt it tastes similar to salmon but lighter, less fishy.)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The store itself is so tiny, you can barely fit 5-6 customers there at the same time.  It's a mom and pop kind of place afterall.  You order the type of fish you like (the fish selection lies on a bed of ice, and yeah it smells a little fishy), and then you order the other toppings, whether you want bread, or salad, or rice to come with the fish.  They also list their daily special fish on the board.  Price varies from $7 to $12, depends on the type of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've ordered the clam chowder soup, one halibut sandwich, one daily special (grouper) sandwich, and a wild sockeye salmon salad.  We were told to wait about 15-20 mins while the fish was grilled.  The fish was perfectly cooked and was very juicy.  The soup was less creamy and thick than what you normally have in other restaurants, but still it had enough clams. What amazed me was that the bread was so fresh and fluffy!\n",
      "\n",
      "We went there around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, and we still saw streams of customers coming in.  I can imagine how busy this place would become during its rush hour.  You can either wait outside where there is a tiny patio, or you can walk out and come back in 10-15 mins.  Trust me, it's all worth it!\n",

They do put lemon pepper on it, which i could live without (a squeeze of lemon or lime would be way better - i will probably ask them to do that next time).

      "Great fresh fish  sandwiches made right there and then with ample flavour and mouth-watering taste. I had randomly found this place while reading blogs and I'm quite surprised there aren't more reviews for this place yet. Nestled in Little Italy a few blocks west of bathurst, this little hole in the wall store doesn't really boast a lot of decor. There is a selection of fresh fish inside, a drinks display, cash register and kitchen. There is a small outdoors patio where a handful of people can sit and enjoy their meal. For approximately $8-$10 you are given only a sandwich. Accompaniments are charged extra. I recommend going with the catch of the day if you don't know which fish to get. Don't worry about how to get it seasoned, the cooks take care of it!\n",

This is the ideal place to pick up a quick fish sandwich on your way to the park or for a quick lunch while shopping on College Street. Of the group, those who asked to eat in got much larger portions than the take-out crowd.  \n",
      "The restaurant is really a shelf full of fresh fish and don't look too far to the left, that's where they do all the wonderful cooking.  \n",
      "Fish is not meant to be deep fried- hallaluah!!  Grilled and served as burritos, sandwiches or salads, the fish is fresh and tasty.  I would highly suggest the sandwich because the bread is soft and hot and toasty. Buttery like a croissant, but big like the Vietnamese rolls.  \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ordered the red snapper sandwich and I was a big fan. Simple sandwiches but the fish was seasoned nicely. It came on a white bun, with red onion, tomato and lettuce. I also really liked the fish because it's grilled not breaded and I think you can taste the fish more when it's not covered in batter. They also put a generous portion of fish on the sandwich so I was glad I didn't order any sides. They have 15 different types of fish everyday so I will definitely go back to try some others. They have plate options too if you don't want a sandwich. Only 2 tables inside so it's better as a take away place. And it's cash only. Every sandwich is between $9-$11 so it's a great deal. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it would have been nice with a spicy mayo sauce or something like that.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Honestly I've always loved this place, I always get the plate with rice and vegetables. Their house made salad dressing it the best, it's a miso dressing. It's a healthy and filling meal. I've always wanted to try the sandwich but haven't because of their pricing system where it's the same price to get either a plate, or a salad, or a sandwich. The plate is obviously better value, whereas the sandwich seems overpriced at over ten bucks...you can get the 5 dollar special sandwich but it's tiny apparently. Also, their prices in general have gone slightly up and they now charge extra for avocado whereas it used to be just a part of the meal and really brought the value up in my eyes. And...this isn't my personal story but my boyfriend told me the last time he went there he ordered a sandwich and the lady asked if he wanted to add avocado, he said yes, but there was already avocado on the sandwich then she also added an unnecessary half avocado on the side, and the avocado costs like $2.50... That's the price of buying an avocado at most markets... So obviously my issue is with the pricing. The people who own it are really nice, they are a family. I've had a couple different people say that on single occasions they've gone in and the people were kind of rude, but I usually tell people to cram it when they say that because they're allowed to have different moods. They've always been really nice in my experience. I think they have a good thing going, there's no other place like them in Toronto.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent food that's healthy if youre craving fish. The brown rice tastes good even though its not the best however there is no white rice option. I tried the wild salmon dish so far with avocado yummy. Only cash and very small seating area\n",

      "This is a small joint that has delicious and fresh seafood. It's a great spot to go to in the summer time. Not so in the winter if you want to sit down. The halibut sandwich was very flavourful and the bun was super soft. Really yummy! I've had the wild salmon and the rainbow trout on rice before and both comes with korean rice and miso sauce that goes amazing with the fish. Though I would like the fish to be grilled and not pan fried. The flavour of the food makes up for it! Go if you are close by!\n",

      "Healthy & Delicious!\n",
      "Wild Salmon on Rice - Salmon was fresh and tasty; Red Rice good - needed the sauce on the side and hot sauce (combined, was delicious); a few pieces of tomatoes, cucumber and 4 olives and extra for avocado $15.00 lunch and worth it!~  Will def have this again and again!\n",

I mean, it consisted of  burger buns, lettuce, swiss cheese, onion, tomato, and about 6 sizzling, crunchy shrimp which to my knowledge didn't have too much garnish. Still, the combination was oddly very satisfying. I like my food to have a lot of flavour through sauces, herbs and spices, but the dressing wasn't at all necessary. Great little place.\n",

Halibut was cooked perfectly, fish was delicate and seasoned well, my only nitpick would be that it needed some sort of a cream sauce. It tasted like it had a balsamic vinegrette drizzled onto the fish, and it soaked onto the foccaccia bun. Overall I was pleased, from what I remember I almost paid 20 dollars for a drink sandwich and salad so it was rather pricy.

The fare is simple and straight-forward and exactly what one wants in a fish place.\n",

Salad was really good, veggies were all fresh and the salmon cooked perfectly.  The soup was a bit of a let down though.

Fish is marinated with a special blend of spices, which all fold into a soft roll. No extra sauce needed. But we discovered a cinnamon-ade ($3.50 will get you a 16 ounces of refreshing accompaniment to the sandwiches. Once grouper sandwich + white fish burrito + large cinnamon-ade for just under $20 CAD.

I've got a cold right now that I'm trying to burn out of my sinuses, so I was hoping for some really good heavy spice that would send me into a flop sweat. I can understand them wanting to err on the conservative side, since I'm SURE they've gotten orders sent back by Gilbert whiteys because \"it was just too spicy!!\".

      "We mainly do pick up orders from this place. Our boys don't care for the food so every now and then we would order for ourselves. The chicken tiki Marsala is delicious and the sauce. We always like to get the garlic naan. We would like to try the place during lunch to try other varieties. The place is small but has good service.\n",

      "The chicken tikka masala was very good, though a bit yellower and more curry-flavored than I've had -- so somewhat different from the traditional, but we liked it very much. The garlic naan is also delicious. Oddly they tried to get us to order two orders of garlic naan right off the bat, but we declined. One was more than enough for two people. The bowl of rice that comes with the order is pretty small, but it's good. Could definitely have used a second one of those. Ended up being $36 with tax and tip for two dishes and naan, which is a little high, but I'd probably still go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was quite pleased to stumble upon this Indian restaurant.  The place is small and lacks in decor but the service and the food was well worth it.  My only complaint was that he chicken tandoori, although delicious, was a bit too salty.  The samosas were great as well as the garlic naan.  I have recommended this restaurant to my friends.  I will definitely go back\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We went for lunch and maybe that was the problem. The selection wasn't as large as I would have expected. On a plus side it was only $20 plus tax per person which is cheap for a nice hotel like this one. My party was all M Life members with gold status and as we stood in the M Life VIP line and the women at the register helped four other people we were confused. Then the points from the Mlife help desk that we had just left to set up a buy one get one free for lunch didn't transfer so it was a bit of a \"starting off on the wrong foot from jump.\" The waiter was nice and attentive.\n",

      "Only 3 stars because the quality is only ok but.... what more could you ask for. It's a buffet! They haves tons of options. The sushi isn't bad. They have unlimited beer wine and champagne. The prime rib was fabulous. The crab legs were dry and the dessert was lacking in my opinion. I would have killed for a warm brownie. But over all a good choice and yummy. Great when you can't decide what you want.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "OK so their dinner i thought nothing was really special (the only great part is them having all u can drink champagne and wine) but i came here on another day for their brunch and their brunch was really good! I think for the price tag for their brunch it really nailed the spot! The prime rib and the braised ox tail hit the spot BIG TIME! I believe that both of these items are what makes this buffet worth it. The crab for me was too dry but the meats for the most part were tender and juicy! I think the prime rib and the ox tails were the only highlights to this meal, everything else was just mediocre. Service here was great! If you're going to vegas on a budget and still want a buffet i would say check this place out otherwise go elsewhere.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "The one thing I don't like is how they have the coffee cups upside down on the table.  The least they could do is put them on coasters so the lip of the glass (where you put your mouth) isn't resting on the table.  You hope the tables are wiped down after each gues, but you KNOW they aren't washed after each guest.  Blah.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sadly their buffet, over my last three visits (one a year) has steadily declined to a level of mediocrity. Their price remains the same! A top notch price with a mediocre buffet.  Their desserts are quite average now and their once outstanding baked or fried chicken is now average. So goes for the other foods I like. I can find better buffets for a lower price than Bayside. \n",
      "\n",
      "My visit to Bayside, on this trip will be my last. Unless I hear of an improvement. I have too many other good buffets and restaurants to enjoy. My reviews for them are posted here. Bye bye Bayside. I am disappointed to experience your decline to mediocrity.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Acceptable buffet. They have a theme setting around the buffet; Asian, Mexican, Southern, Italian. Salad bar was great. Desserts were ok. The meat was pretty good, chicken a bit dry. Still having trouble swallowing the high prices.\n"

If you're coming here for interesting food options, then you're better off at other buffet places on the Strip, like Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan.

The ones that I enjoyed and went back for seconds were the marinated steak, prime rib, osso bucco and the oxtail stew. I was in a meat coma afterwards. I also enjoyed their collard greens and steamed veggie mix of squash\\/carrots\\/broccoli - had to make sure I ate my veggies too.\n",
      "I generally don't have a sweet tooth but I decided to indulge of some of their dessert treats since we were on vacation anyway. I tried and enjoyed a bit of their bread pudding, classic cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake, berry cobbler, and apple pie ala mode. Man was I over my daily caloric intake for the day! Hahaha. We also had coffee, hot tea, and pineapple juice (not always available so bonus that they had it). Service was decent although she did forget the juices initially. Would consider coming back here especially if staying here at the resort.\n",

Some people are probably easily fooled into thinking that the food here is really good just because the dining room is so picturesque. I mean it was nice, sitting on the patio with a view, but it pretty much ends there. I must have taken one bite of everything on my plate and pushed it aside. The carrot cake was the only thing that I thought was good enough to finish. It's definitely not worth the wait. For around the same price though, I'd rather be at Paris or the Bellagio buffet.\n",

The excitement of having crab legs with my eggs, pancakes and bacon was great, but I really wish I wouldn't have done that. I would have been better off saving room and being able to eat all of my grits. Or just having fruit and some water to replenish. But who does that at a buffet?! When there are crab legs and pancakes?! \n",

That's just too bad I say though because my three mimosas would have tasted much better with a do-it myself omelet or a waffle bar.  They were good regardless, but the delicious bacon wrapped pork, or the fried shrimp just didn't do to my belly what i had wanted to happen.  I wanted magic.  I wanted taste explosions.  I wanted my stomach to thank me personally.  But all that happened was a too full belly, $20 i'll never get back, some wasted food on multiple plates, and some nasty gas.\n",

The little edges of fat gave the prime rib some flavor, but overall, it was a little bland. The salmon was well..... salmony? The shrimp is fried shrimp you know, just battered and fried shrimp.\n",

      "Plate 2! I had the crab legs only. OK, I know I don't eat much at buffets, but the dessert is an exception. The crab legs were not chilled; they were actually quite warm. They were salty, but really delicious. If only I had the stone crab claws. I had sampled one and it was DELISH!\n",

No lines and they offer self online registers.\n",

The fresh blackberries\\/blueberries were fresh, though when it was out, they replaced it with Strawberries instead.  The kids got their milk in plastic disposable cups.  The champagne tasted quite good, though I just had 1\\/2 glass and had to drive after breakfast. The pastries like the croissant and some desserts (ie. bread pudding) were excellent as well.  I would say $30 for breakfast is a tad on the high side but unfortunately, we came on a Friday instead of a Thursday morning and that was the only choice available. \n",

They put the exact same food items on both sides of the buffet, so you initially think there's going to be double the options that are actually available. Also, I'm not sure if all buffets do this, but it's annoying giving a tip before you even know what service is going to be like. Maybe that's just me though.\n",

      "Mediocre buffet at best. I stay and play at Mandalay Bay quite frequently and the buffets usually come either complimentary or they come with the stay when I book a reservation. The last stay I completed with Mandalay Bay I received the two buffets and when we arrived there was nobody at the host station. Odd.. especially for a peak busy weekend night. I started at the pizza station where I found most of the pizza burnt with the lack of tomato sauce. Pepperoni pizza that had about 3 and a half pieces of pepperoni lol. The Italian station was just as bad and I think I was only impressed with the meatballs and kept it moving. The carving station usually is my favorite and even that was off. Meat looked so dry and just not even appealing to eat! The service was actually good and our waitress was very attentive with keeping the drinks filled. I believe that if they could only improve on the food quality that would help the foot traffic of this buffet. You have to ask yourself sometimes why are they offering the buffet for free with certain promotions on the room. It's a marketing strategy that obviously helps increase the number of people to visit and eat. But it's going to take more than just an offer to come eat comp'd for me.. I need the food to improve.\n"

      "Our family went to the buffet on a Sunday around 1:00, there wasn't any wait.  It seems a little over priced at $29 for what you get.  The upside - hot crab legs and prime rib, the prime rib seemed to be hit or miss on the cut, some were OK and some were very fatty. The kids loved the breakfast items and the dessert bar, waffle cones were a big hit.  The down side, the service.  Our waiter came back once to refill drinks then was MIA. At some point another server started taking our plates but we ended up having to stack them on another table.  The kids loved it.  I would have rated it a little higher for $20, but not that great for $29.\n",

      "$23 for lunch. Plenty of seating spaced apart. Wednesday around 12:40pm no wait whatsoever. Their sushi selection is lame (four grocery quality rolls) but they had a better Chinese selection (fried rice, show mien, sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, tofu, pot stickers) than MGM Grand. They offered a pasta station where you chose the items and they cook for you (marinara or cream sauce; I chose Marinara and was less than impressed with the taste) Their Italian option is Bleh. Cici pizza looking slices, cheese ravioli and wrapped pasta. The carving station only offered beef or turkey. Shrimp cocktails were on the smaller side and not fresh ice cold. A pretty impressive selection of protein: oxtail, veal, pork chop, ribs, different types of chicken, and fish. As I was staying in the Southside, coming here was easy using the tram from Excaliber. Not sure I would bother venturing here otherwise  unless I was already around here. It's really not that bad of an option, I only came because I had a complimentary pass. It turned out better then expected after yesterday's disappointing MGM Grand Buffet experience.\n",

      "I do not like buffets at all, but you can't come to Vegas without trying a buffet, right? So on our way back from the Shark Reef, we stopped in to get some food. Paid about $30 at the kiosk, and were immediately seated.  Service was great. Food wasn't bad, and there were plenty of non seafood options to choose from as well. For someone who doesn't typically enjoy buffets, I definitely ate my money's worth. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only gripe was that there were no bathrooms in the restaurant, and you had to walk across the hall of the Mandaly Bay resort to get to one.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "No wait for lunch at 12:00pm!  We used a my Vegas offer but I get one free which was a great deal. There were many different options from sushi to a pasta station, Mexican, pizza a salad bar. Like many buffets the food was just ok!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A little bit better than most buffets in Vegas due to the fact that a) it's never that busy b) they seem to have fresher food than other buffets. It's one of those buffets where sure if you are in the casino and you are hungry then yes you might as well eat there. But don't make any special arrangements to go there - you would be quite upset.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was alright for lunch. It costs $20 for a reasonable amount of tasty foods, but it didn't really \"hit that spot\" for me. The prime rib was juicy and flavorful, but that was the only thing that I really liked there. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what the hype was about it. Maybe I should try dinner?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Free with my room I made the all day buffet my bitch by eating my weight in crab legs... \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not the Wynn buffett, but seriously, what is?  It also doesn't cost as much.  I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here, but if you get a deal and aren't expecting haute cuisine, it's not terrible.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had a pleasant experience here! A huge part of that was due in fact to our wonderful server Lisa. She really made us feel comfortable and we certainly enjoyed our meal and time there. I wouldn't expect any less of Mandalay Bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bayside is slightly lower in price but the same vegas buffet staples are still there like crab legs which unfortunately were not warm and split open like other buffets prepare them. A bummer for my husband since he prefers them that way but a huge relief for me- I could ease my stresses of him from digging into this high cholesterol indulgence. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note: A wonderful alternative to the busy buffets along the main area of the strip- we were seated right away.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This used to be my favorite buffet on the strip. However, we've been twice in recent years and found  the prices have been raised and the standards lowered. The selection is not what it once was, and the food choices uninspired. Very sad.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "$26 for Sunday brunch plus $5 for bottomless mimosa and champagne.  Average food and service. \n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at THEhotel and had a food credit towards any restaurant at the resort, chose this buffet for convenience and well, I would have to pass on this buffet next time. It's pretty pricey for the quality of food they serve. All breakfast items were so so, scrambled eggs were not so great, bacon wasn't crisp, however the large sausage was pretty good. The eggs Benedict was dry up and looked unappetizing. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a Chinese food section, however not worth trying. The crab legs were skinny and the shrimp were in shell and kind of fresh. The prime rib, ox tail, and ossobuco were the entrees I actually enjoyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert section is solid tho. Cherry and white chocolate chip cookies are awesome along with the dense chocolate cake.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had dinner here tonight.  $26.99.  It was a nice buffet with a nice dining room and view of the pool area.  Everything I tried was good, but nothing just stood out as absolutely great.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They had both hot crab legs (that you crack yourself) and the cold ones that are already cut in half.  Many other dishes to choose from as well.  The deserts were very good.   \n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed that they close this buffet down between lunch and dinner times, so you can't come a little early, pay the lunch price, and have the dinner offerings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd certainly go back if in the area, but I think I liked the Bellagio buffet a little better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Lowered a star today since the cashier soured our experience. She had an attitude when we were trying to use our M life\\/ MyVegas reward for the BOGO breakfast. Also, it took her forever to process the credit card. 3 parties who arrived after us (and were processed by the other cashier) were seated before we were. There might be a glitch in the system, but she didn't say anything. People usually say \"sorry, my computer's acting up\", or something along that line when this happens. I guess nobody trained her to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, food was good for the price, and our server was great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We went for their christmas brunch at $29.99 a head, with champagne provided for free. There was a decent selection of food, including crab legs, smoked salmon, prime rib, Korean short ribs, cocktail shrimp, and other quality items. There was even a section serving Asian entrees such as chow mein, kailan, orange chicken, etc. I felt the crab legs, kailan, and a couple other items were too salty, but the rest were quite good. The dessert was very exquisite; there were several mousses and cakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it's a pretty good buffet, but doesn't offer too much over a buffet you can get for $15.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good food.   But not as wide of a selection as comparable to Bellagio.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pro: Pretty wood decor, short line, good braised *insert meat here*. Good service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Con: short line for a reason, crappy desert, old and dry chinese and mexican food. very unfriendly crew behind the craving station. beat up salad bar\n",
      "\n",
      "Came here to try the buffet again since the last visit close to 9 years ago, while this place isn't bad, it is also not that great. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would have to recommend to stay away from this place.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Oh...goodness. Like many of the hotel buffets in Vegas, this place offers the \"Eat All Day Long\" option. My family took up this challenge, mostly for the deal. It's a pretty good buffet, but eating all three meals here is a bit...much. I totally regretted going for it. But eating one meal here is not so bad. \n",
      "The dessert section was definitely the highlight, but isn't that always the case? I liked the fruit tarts and mousse. They also have a small cylindrical cheesecake sample that is the perfect size. All cheesecake portions should be that size...seriously.\n",
      "The evening of my battle with this buffet also happened to be the same day that the GameStop convention was being held at the Mandalay Bay. This meant many, many hungry gamers in the hotel. It was extremely annoying to have to wait in a super long line for food at a buffet. I don't even understand why people were lining up, but in fear of being accused of cutting, I joined the flock. But even with the insane amount people (most of them gamers), the service was great. \n",
      "I don't know if it's worth the price for one meal, but eat enough crab meat and blackberries and you'll probably get your money's worth.\n",

      "I'm going to preface this by saying part of our hotel booking included credits for a daily buffet, for the two of us. Had it not been for those credits, we probably wouldn't have bothered going at all. With those credits, we went 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed. For it being the Mandalay Bay, I honestly expected a better buffet. Having read previous reviews though, I knew not to expect too much...and even then, it was still vastly underwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first visit was during the dinner hour and, luckily, we got there before the rush (though, you wouldn't know it because it was still a madhouse). Best part? There was a couple who partook in the unlimited beer\\/wine thing they had, and the lady drunkenly HUGGED the dude behind the counter before exclaiming how drunk she was. Vegas at its finest. Worst part? The service. We probably had 4 plates on our table before our dude finally picked them up, we always had to ask for refills...and I'm not really sure why it's seemingly allowed to have children LAY on the floor in the middle of the walkways while their parents eat at a table. Maybe that's not a MB thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Second visit was during their champagne brunch buffet, and that was at least more worth it for me...if only because I took advantage of the cheap champagne and had several glasses with my cranberry juice. This visit had much better service than the first, which was surprising because it was WAY busier.\n",
      "\n",
      "So again...had it not been for those credits, we wouldn't have bothered with the buffet. Especially if the lines were as long as they were during our stay there. Also? Don't eat the sushi...the one I picked up smelled like it was rotting.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My coworkers and I met here for breakfast last week when in Vegas for a trade show.  We had the buffet but I found it confusing and congested, and difficult to navigate.  That and the food offered was nothing real special.  Wouldn't probably choose to go back again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Did whole day buffet deal  ($43)on a Sunday. Brunch included champagne and had a wide variety of breakfast\\/lunch items including omlettes, crab legs, sushi, steaks including prime rib, fruit, cheeses, tamales, carnitas, potstickers, spring rolls, lamb chops, smoked salmon and trout, and a wide variety of desserts. Dinner was less impressive with many of the brunch items still on the menu - but no champagne. \n",
      "\n",
      "Probably better to do the whole day buffet deal on regular weekday and just do the brunch on Sunday. Service was good and the ambiance is good. Highlight was the crab legs and desserts.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We did the Sunday brunch buffet and it had lots of offerings. Some items were a little dry or hard (pancakes, French toast sticks, etc). Other items were delicious and I paid the extra to have the endless \"Brut\". The waitress was a little sarcastic when I needed extra orange juice to out with my champagne, so that was annoying, but she did eventually bring it out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Service was great. Patrons around us not so much. To maximize your value, start with the item you really want to eat first. Flank steak, beef short ribs, all excellent. The flatbread pizzas are AMAZING!! Crab legs were mediocre. Word to the wise wait till they bring fresh ones. Don't eat the crab legs that are at the bottom of the Schaffer.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We succumbed to laziness and ate here. We know it's over priced and the food are your regular buffet menu. Except for the ox tail. A bit chewy but at least it's something new. \n",
      "\n",
      "What more can I say... bleh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eat outside. Support local restaurants.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for lunch.   There was only a small percentage of items that even looked appetizing for me to try.  Also this buffet did nearly nothing to try to separate itself from even low end vegas buffets which is a shame considering its one of the top MGM resorts in Vegas.   No crab legs for lunch, no made to order waffles or crepes, not even a gelato station.  They did have a made to order pasta station but I found the options of what could be made there half hearted.\n",
      "On a positive their flank steak had great flavor and their carved new york loin roast was well above par as far as buffet carving roasts go.  Also you couldnt go wrong with the large cocktail shrimp.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We were starving after arriving and checking in to the hotel. We walked around the casino stopping to look at the menus posted outside of the different restaurants and so many entrees were $20-$30 for just a salad or a sandwich so when we saw that the all you can eat brunch buffet was only $25.99 we were sold! My husband who loves his meat dishes was in meat heaven. He loved loved loved the korean flavored marinated steak. He also enjoyed the prime rib, oso bucco and oxtail. I'm more of a seafood fan and was not as impressed with the selection. My go to dish at any buffet are the crab legs and the crab legs here are by far the scrawniest crab legs I've ever had. They also had shrimp cocktail which tasted fine, mussels, and a small selection of sushi which was more rice than actual fish. I saved a little room for dessert and thoroughly enjoyed their oreo cheesecake and soft serve ice cream in a waffle cone. Overall not a bad deal for the price, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back, but if I was already staying in the Mandalay or Delano, I'd be willing to eat here again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "***$27.99 dinner buffet**** I would have thought that for this price, I would have had great food..... unfortunatly not. I was very diappointed, I went last fall and it was great. Now its shity service, slow waiters, bad food etc..... The only thing I did enjoy were the crab legs... which I ate the most of. I will not return here and pay this hideous amount of money. It Sucks !\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Huge variety of food nice staff good deal\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food selection and quality are a bit above average for a buffet.  The $42.99\\/all day pass is definitely a bargain, but you'll end up eating too much and wondering why the heck you couldn't just be satisfied with one plate, since it's just not that good.  I'd recommend filling up on the shrimp\\/salmon\\/beef and skipping the sushi and greasy looking options.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had myVegas reward points to redeem at this buffet, so we decided to try the brunch\\/lunch on a weekday. The breakfast was okay and tasted like any other breakfast place like IHOP or Denny's. However, they do have delicious lox and crepes. The wait for the brunch was not too long and the service was excellent. The waitress for our table was very helpful and attend to our needs frequently. I would like to try their dinner buffet next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I dined here last Saturday during lunch and paid about $43 for two people. They have a lot of food choices, although I would rate the taste of all the dishes I tried as a MEH. They did refill the sodas and waters on a consistent basis and the staff was pleasant and professional. I think I enjoyed the desserts the best; Everything I tried was good. My favorite was the coconut and pudding concoction.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kinda disappointed in the quality of food at breakfast. I'd eaten the dinner buffet in the past and was satisfied. I loved the pasta bar, so I was excited to be up early enough to catch breakfast however, I was let down. The food was hardly seasoned, all rolls or biscuits were like rocks. And the options were few, each side had the same selection. The server Gloria was great but I don't think I'll be eating breakfast here again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was okay, pretty average. I don't feel that it was worth the money. There is free alcohol but it's only a few select wines and just bud light. There is a decent selection of food, and what was available was good so no complaints.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Way to expensive for what you get. The choices where limited and not real value. Quality was average not more. Family of four was over $120. Not worth it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We came here for breakfast and there was no wait.  However, one table had four people smoking and the server didn't do anything about it.  The service was prompt and the place was clean.  The food was OK for the price.  We'll be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think 3.5 stars is about right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here last Saturday night after narrowing it down to Rio and Mandalay Bay.  Mandalay Bay won out this time because we ate at Rio the last time we were in Vegas.  It's always good to try something new, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "For about $30, you're treated to a better-than-average Vegas buffet.  I think for about $35, you can eat all day long. I'm not really sure if that requires you sitting in the restaurant all day and eating, or whether it means you can leave and come back to eat whenever you want.  Either way, it sounds awesome; I mean, I think the prospect of having a buffet be your day-long prison is a pretty sweet and ridiculous idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, here are some highlights:\n",
      "+ Lots of seafood!  Crab legs! Many salmony salmons! White fishies! Scallops!  Big shrimp!  Yay scavengers of the sea!\n",
      "+ Meats!  Chicken legs! Fried! Veal! Stewed! Prime rib! Other many meats for to eat!  Even though I've been trying to eat less red meat, I was like oh screw it, I'm eating well tonight!\n",
      "+ The Asian foods:  not spectacular, but I still appreciate it being there.  Sushi, pot stickers, Chinese foods, etc.  All decent-tasting!\n",
      "+ Desserts!  Many! All good!  That's saying a lot!  Because I don't have a sweet tooth!\n",
      "+ And one of my FAVORITE parts of the meal: they had CHEESES!  I am a lover of the CHEESES, so when I saw the CHEESES I got all drooly and excited and piled all the CHEESES (they's got blue CHEESES, other hard CHEESES that I can't remember, etc.) on my plate, and that was my dessert.  Loved the addition and the tastes of the CHEESES.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must also note that the dining rooms are very pretty, with dim lighting and a comfortable atmosphere.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, overall, I enjoyed this buffet a lot, wasn't blown away, but would consider coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, if you're deciding on ONE buffet to eat in Vegas, you gotta hit up the Rio buffet.  It is KICK ASS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aite, and with that, I'm out.\n"

      "This place has the crab and the jumbo shrimp but for some reason there seafood has no flavor. I think they probably boiled the crap out of it. Selection was modest and the quality of the other goods were pretty good. The prime rib was so rare it was still mooing which was great, very nicely done. Deserts were disappointing with the selection and quality. The had bread pudding without the white sauce, which really doesn't work. Service is also quite slow so it might take some time to clear the table of seafood rampage.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here for breakfast since we had a gift card from staying at this hotel. Nice selection of food although I noticed a lot of the food was cold. The herb crusted salmon was cold which wasn't good at all. The bacon was super greasy. The hash brown was good, but cold. The fruits were yummy and sweet. Some of the meat was too dry. Food was a miss for me but service was great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had their brunch. It was decent. The french toast sticks were good quality.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "While my wife and I only had breakfast and brunch here, we did go twice, so I feel this review is representative of the kind of food and service you should expect.  The hostess service that works the line after payment takes longer than expected to get you to your table considering it is a buffet.  I guess there are still server sections, so maybe this makes sense.  I was glad to see a hot carafe of coffee already on the table as we sat down.  The server will then take your drink order for nearly any other juice or hot beverage.  The first thing I'll mention about the food selection is that the prime rib was surprisingly good, I mean really good.  There was a nice salty, herb crust on the outside which was quite satisfying.  The omelet station was very busy, but the cook was quickly working 5-6 omelets as once, while dealing out Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay anecdotes.  Nice touch and better than staring blankly at him while he cooks.  The cheese blintz were quite good and very addictive.  I'd recommend throwing some strawberry sauce on top.  If you are a carb-ovore, you will be pleased with an entire bakery selection on the opposite side of the dining area.  Overall, a nice breakfast, but nothing that will be memorable outside of this review.  It's relatively inexpensive at $17 for breakfast and $24 for brunch (in terms of Las Vegas anyhow.)  It is also convenient, especially if you are coming from THEhotel or the Mandalay Bay hotel rooms on your way to the convention center.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good but not great. I compare every buffet to\n",
      "The Aria buffet which is a 5 star buffet. Good staple buffet and only $5 for endless mimosas which was great. They served all the staple buffet foods such as  shrimp, crab legs, steak, mashed potatoes, pancakes, fish, chicken. It was enjoyable and we would recommend it\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was good but not the best. Server did a great job with getting drinks and plates out the way. But wouldn't recommend going there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Another typical breakfast buffet restaurant. Service was excellent, server was very attentive not a large buffet selections but it is a quality not the quantity that count for me. Fruits were sweet and fresh. Ordered omelette just tad overdone than I like but it was tasty.  Would I go back, yes for breakfast.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was decent, desserts were fabulous.  A lot of things lack labels, especially at the dessert station.  Ate here for lunch, okay selection of foods.  Turkey at the carving station was great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Buffets are not about quality, let's just get that right out there. Buffets are about QUANTITY and getting as much for your dollar as possible. Because of this, I'm generally not a huge fan of buffet style eating. But that aside, the Bayside Buffet isn't half bad when compared against others in Vegas. It has one distinct advantage for sure, FREE ALCOHOL. Yep, they have red and white wine and champagne and it's free. It's not high end but it's as decent as anything you'd be served on a plane. Every other buffet I've been too charged extra for alcohol of any kind. So free alcohol is a Bayside \"plus\". The food was ok, not tremendous but not bad. For seafood lovers they have crab legs, mussels, shrimp, Lox, baked salmon, baked swai (aka..basa) ,  a few different sushi rolls and cioppino (very spicy). The mussels were tender, not rubbery, and the baked fish dishes were both moist, not overcooked and dried out. The shrimp were a good size too. If you're not a fan of seafood, they have pizza (which looked decent), prime rib and chicken . For veggie lovers you'll find things like asparagus and corn on the cob. The dessert section is fairly vast as well with a nice assortment of fresh baked cookies, cobbler, tiramisu, bread pudding, carrot cake, chocolate cake, soft serve frozen yogurt and more. For the $30 entry price you will certainly get your monies worth. So if you're doing Vegas on a budget or simply don't feel satisfied by smaller restaurant portions, the Bayside Buffet just might be your thing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Bayside Buffet on Mandalay Bay Casino really upgraded this buffet. We went a few years ago and it was terrible. We read they had changed it and decided to give it a try, esp since the line was not long. We ate the lunch buffet on a Friday and it was excellent. Granted there was not a 300+ item selection like the fancier buffets, but they had enough good food. Great carved meat selection, italian selection, and other items. Also, had a new dessert bar, not a lot of choices, with personal service and great selection. Very good! Definitely will go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I hate the word buffet and I really hate the concept of a buffet but sometime I get roped into attending one of the feeding frenzies, but it's never my first choice. I will admit this isn't you're typical buffet but there's still the possibility that you will over eat if you don't show a little restraint. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what exactly does $32.95 get you, for one it gives you a choice to choose wisely or just be plain stupid. I usually like to do a tour before making my selections, the first thing I noticed was that all the serving dishes are small this is an added measure taken to protect the interest of The Bayside Buffet's owners but also protects you from yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always go for the carving stations and this buffet not only had plenty of those options but the quality was pretty good as well. My first plate held my prime rib, sliced turkey and a fried chicken breast and to be honest I loved every bite and could have stopped there but the trays of food were calling my name even though I chose to sit at a table as far away from the mounts of food as possible. My second plate was for the sushi and a few steamed dumplings and a few pieces of cheese. The most satisfying part of attending this buffet was the fact that I was able to avoid the cakes, pies, and cookies and even walked away from the donuts.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good and bad.  The carver took out a new roast because I wanted as close to rare as possible.  Bad is the snow crab legs, dry as dry can be and so little crab for all the work.  Las Vegas Buffet on Flamingo had better crab for 13$.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was a must come in vegas 10 years  ago, classy, wonderful quality of food and wide variety... they stopped improving their menu and now it seems just ordinary, even the Luxor buffet and Excalibur are WAAAAAY better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you're hungry and you're hungry? Eat here. It was late. We were hungry and were, well, in a hurry to eat. Didn't want to wait somewhere to sit and order and wait some more. I'd probably order a salad for the same price anyway thanks to ALL the overpriced Vegas food. This way I got  to eat what I wanted and had my coffee and cake too! \n",
      "I would never plan it this way though. Bellagio buffet is where my heat is.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay price with great service. The food selection leaves something to be desired during lunch and the food itself wasn't great. A lot of things were cold and tasted like it was made a few hours ago.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After visiting the buffet a few times I must say it was pretty good. I realize that in Las Vegas there are many better places for breakfast or brunch. However, the buffet was reasonably priced, a good selection of American Classic foods, Luis it's a buffet so in true American fashion you can eat all you can ;) \n",
      "\n",
      "The selection of food is quite decent, there are the usual so like scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, home fries, coffee, cereals, and so on. So it is a nice American style breakfast. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would certainly be back, as it's such an easy choice to make in the morning it's breakfast and it's a buffet what can go wrong?\n"

      "We visited this buffet for dinner last night. The food was good. The server was terrible, we only drink water and we always had an empty cup. Our table of 4 guests had about 10 cups in the center when we left and we stacked our empty plates on an adjacent table.  For the $142 price tag, the overall experience left something to be desired, but I am happy the food was good. The crab legs were excellent.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've only been to \\/ in comparison to buffets at Aria, Cosmo & Bellagio, this was the smallest spread (but still plentiful, with a good variety). I don't recall anything that seemed to be a \"specialty\" to the buffet. However, the food itself was good and priced well. To me it's a buffet off the list, wouldn't plan to go back but if the group was going and \\/ or in the area I wouldn't be upset or mind going back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for dinner because of crab legs but they were cold. But they have a cook to heat it but, unfortunately the crabs were taken out of the water to soon and all of them except a couple legs were hot. Looks like the waitresses were over worked, but still did a good job.  Other than the crab legs every thing else was good.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I stay at MB fairly frequently, and often end up at their buffet. I'm never disappointed by their carving stations, their mashed potatoes are very creamy, and like that they have (American-style) Chinese food. They steam crab legs too, which is a big plus to my wife. Their desserts are so-so; they used to have a great mini-tirimisu that I could eat a half dozen of, but the last few times I did not see them there. Service is generally good as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'd like to give this place 3 1\\/2 stars but can't do that. Typically I round up, but I'm trying to rate all buffets equally and since I rounded down on the Bacchanal review I rounded down here too! Really, though, for the price this is a decent breakfast buffet. Well especially since it was free with a myVegas reward!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice ambiance, bright and airy. Great coffee, and excellent service. Typical breakfast buffet items, scrambled eggs, omelet station, miscellaneous other items. Nothing standout but nothing bad either. Given you would pay at least $5 for coffee and $5 for a pastry, this place really seems like a bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not something I'd go out of my way for but if you are in the area it's not a bad breakfast deal.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here is mediocre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad, but not super good. If you're a foodie, you will have to choose wisely. Not everything in the buffet is good, but you must pick and choose. There are some diamonds in there.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I came here on a Friday for lunch a few months ago. We had scored BOGO tickets for our meal. The meal was a GREAT deal! For the two of us (for a lunch buffet), we paid $23 total. I would definitely come back to this place in a heart beat. The value was phenomenal for the price. But of course for the next time I'd do the same thing, pick out the delicious things (and trust me, there are some- including yummy Lox!) out of the sea of mediocre food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We went at lunch, and for a major Vegas buffet, the slim amount of people eating was not a good sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lunch choices were mediocre, which isn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food just wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, considering Mandalay would be the higher end of the Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay trio on this end of the strip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waitstaff however was very courteous and prompt, and my glass was never more than half empty, so props to them.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decided to try a new buffet and I would say this isn't the best however, the service was great compared to other buffets! \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a variety of different types of food, however the quality weren't that great. They also have a Pasta Bar, but it was kind of a let down. Dessert is opposite sides of where the \"hot\" food was. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was okay haha, but I rather go elsewhere.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "First I have to say that the service was an A+!  The waiter was very attentive and very friendly.  We got there around 1pm and the food selection was great but the restaurant was not busy so the food turnover was not there.  I noticed that the sushi wasn't the freshest.  The avocado on some of them were browning and the fish just didn't look appealing at all.  I took the last avocado rolls and noticed that they did not refill the item the whole time we were there.  My husband enjoyed the freshly made pasta as he selected the pasta, sauce and fixing in the pasta.  They had a good selection of Asian, Mexican, Italian and American food.  The food quality was not the best but overall it was not the worse.  I just wonder if I had came earlier if the food turnover would have been better.  \n",
      "The dessert selection was above average.  I enjoyed the carrot cake and cheese danish.  Lastly, I did thought the place was very clean and had a great atmosphere.  We sat next to the window and enjoyed the view of their outside.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Its got ur usual Las Vegas buffet flare, as the posts before me has kindly pointed out.  Not my favorite place to go, but great if ur already staying at Mandalay Bay or THE hotel (just because i'm lazy)  If you can get a table by the window.. that would rock!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall, a pretty good buffet and experience. There was a very little wait for dinner, and the price was reasonable. The staff, from the hostess to our waiter, was all pretty friendly. The pasta chef was super kind, maintained a good conversation and taught me a little bit about the pasta sauce he was making which I thought was cool! \n",
      "\n",
      "They have many food stations, from seafood to pasta to Asian, so I thought their menu covered a pretty good-sized range. The custom-order pasta station was the probably best part. \n",
      "\n",
      "While there wasn't anything in particular that was super phenomenal, the good food and atmosphere makes it a place I could come back to in the future.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We did both breakfast and dinner here. Each had their good and bad points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast-\n",
      "Good: Bacon, coffee, apple crepes, bear claws \n",
      "\n",
      "Bad: Scrambled eggs (tasted like they were made with sour milk), sausage, home fries (frozen triangle thingies they must have microwaved)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner-\n",
      "Good: shrimp (cocktail and fried, both good), kung pao beef, coconut cream pie, salad bar, fruit, cold meats and cheeses\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad: flatiron steak (looked pink and rare but was tough and chewy)\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also not crazy about having to wait for someone to bring my beverages. Self service is much better (like MORE buffet at the Luxor)\n",
      "\n",
      "There are better buffets for the price, but we ate here twice because we were staying at THEHotel at Mandalay Bay. We don't plan on staying there again so I doubt we will be eating here again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "During our recent trip to Las Vegas, we went to the buffet at the M Hotel.  However, there was a very long line and the lady in front of me said it would be at least a 2 hour wait.  My hubby suggested that we just dine at the Mandalay Bayside Buffet since since we were staying there...I immediately agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at the Bayside Buffet for Sunday dinner which cost $29 per person and there was no line...sweet.  They have kiosk stations where you can pay for your dinner buffet and then get seated.  The buffet area is not as large as I expected but included the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1)  Open Bar\n",
      "Unlimited champagne, white and red wine, and beer.  This was a pleasant surprise, especially since the champagne was pretty good.  Either get your drink at the bar area and\\/or just ask your server.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2)  American Section:\n",
      "Baked chicken, steamed and hot crab legs, braised oxtails, ribs, mashed potatoes, potato wedges, vegetables, a carving station for roast beef, turkey, and pork.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3)  Italian Section:\n",
      "Pasta bar, lasagna, chicken parmesan, sauteed vegetables\n",
      "\n",
      "(4)  Asian Section:\n",
      "Various dim sums, fried rice, noodles, stir fry veges, orange chicken, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "(6)  Mexican Section:\n",
      "Taco Bar, Tamales, Rice, Beans and the fixings.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7)  Salad Bar:\n",
      "Very limited and messy.\n",
      "\n",
      "(8)  Cold Seafood Section:\n",
      "Oysters on the Half Shell, Shrimp Cocktail, and limited Sushi\n",
      "\n",
      "(9)  Dessert Section:\n",
      "Various types of desserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dinner consisted of the steamed crab legs with lots of butter, braised oxtail, vegetables, mashed potatoes, dessert, and lots of champagne.  I tried the roast beef, shrimp cocktail, and some of the other Italian offerings but they were just average....nothing special.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bayside Buffet offers a great dinner value that includes your alcoholic drinks during dinner.  I would return for their crab legs and unlimited champagne.  3 Stars!\n"

      "We went for Sunday brunch. It was definitely price friendly compared to other buffets we visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The breakfast options were great. Tons of meats and an omelette  and carving station. The bananas were brown and less popular food items looked like they had sat out a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desserts were average.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was empty and clean which is huge compared to other buffets.\n",

      "\n",
      "We tried the Mandalay Bay's Bayside Buffet recently, where its $43 all-day pricing was set to save us $21 apiece. We planned on spending a quiet day at the hotel, anyway -- relax at the property's 11-acre beach between breakfast and lunch, and playing some slots and visiting the shark reef aquarium before dinner -- so we did not feel \"trapped\" there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast went well. The house coffee went beyond our expectations, the bacon was nice and crispy, and you could find all the usual breakfast suspects here like scrambled eggs, waffles and lots and lots of smoked salmon. What's more, there was a surprising inclusion of south-of-the-border Mexcian fare served up as well, including some very delicious tamales I just could not stop eating. Maybe the best tamales I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch was just fine. Prime rib and crab legs were now available, as were some scrumptious barbecued short ribs. The selection was decent, but not very exciting -- there was no \"wow\" factor. The flavors were good, but not great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choices at this time of day were also infused with many Latin American flavors, including chorizo and beef sausage, a pleasant tomatillo salad, and my favorite tamales. It was, however, a bit disconcerting to see my darling meaty corn husks piled up in the same hotel pan I had left them pining for my gullet several hours ago. Were they the same ones that were put out at breakfast?\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper was a lot less impressive, though maybe it was because we were still full from eating there twice that day already. Unfortunately, there was nothing new or spectacular offered that evening that we did not see at lunch time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure there were a couple of new Asian dishes and a curry or two, and there was some flank steak (that was just a bit tough to bite), but nothing else really worth mentioning. Even the pasta station that was in full swing that night and had a nice selection of sauces, came up short by serving pasta that not quite al dente.\n",
      "\n",
      "After getting our fill at breakfast and lunch, we felt another meal here was overdoing it, so we left feeling stodgy after a couple of bites, and ended up quelling our later-that-night hunger pans with a couple of Belgian beers and a some items off the bar menu at Tender in the nearby Luxor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did we get our money's worth?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would happily pay $15 for breakfast here, and even more so if I managed to get in as they were transitioning to lunch (just before 11 am). I also feel their $16 is a fair price for lunch, but again, I would try to make this a brunch visit, and would not eat both breakfast and lunch here, never mind three full meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, you'd have to value dinner here at $12 at least, to make this one-day pass worth it, and it could be, if you don't mind lots of routine and want to stick to a $42-a-day food budget.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kinda pricey for two people at dinner and the selection is not overly abundant. They did have some good lamb chops, prime rib, and crab legs when I was here. Plus they had an unlimited wine and beer bar. I am not sure I will be back\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Got a free buffet at Bayside from MyVEGAS and stopped in this evening. The good, desserts and a few different selections. The bad, really felt that the quality was low. The meat I got off the carving stations was cold. The fried chicken was good as was the meatballs. My server was attentive and my cup never went empty. If I had paid for this I would have been disappointed but it was worth what I paid, free.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "#1 Pro - best crab legs in a Vegas buffet (as far as I know). They are legit king crab legs.. you know, the huge, meaty ones with the sharp little things poking from the legs. \n",
      "\n",
      "#1 Con - dessert station... I mean, at least at the Bellagio, no matter how full you may think you are, one look and you find the tiniest space in your stomach to force something down. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other that, I love their eggs benedict and french toast. Their mac n cheese tasted like the cheese came from packs, their prime rib is alright, mashed potatoes are not as good as the Bellagio and Wynn. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if I'm comparing it so much to the Bellagio, why did I give it the same number of stars??... Crab legs, people. It's worth it if you are like me, and 95% of your Vegas buffet meal consist of crablegs, 2% is butter, and the last 3% consist of whatever else you feel like fitting into your life.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's your standard buffet fare.  Some good stuff, mostly mediocre stuff.  I went here for lunch and there was zero line on a Friday.  Price was also very fair for a Vegas buffet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I liked about the buffet a lot was the seating area overlooking the pool.  The huge windows windows added a nice feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couple things to note that I enjoyed were the oso buco, meatballs, salt and pepper shrimp, and sesame balls (in the chinese food area).  A couple of the desserts like the cheesecake and fruit cobbler was good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was an OK buffet.  If you're looking for excellent buffet food you would definitely be better off going to Bacchanal or something.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Given this is my third meal here during this stay (and I got one more to go), it warrants a review.\n",
      "\n",
      "If what you have in mind is a grand spread like Bellagio or Wynn, or Ceasars, it's a far cry.  Think more like when a hometown diner puts up a sign for \"all you can eat\" and adds some cheap $7.99 platter of late night Vegas style prime rib and super skinny crab legs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's a very convenient place if you're staying here to grab a quick light bite.  Yes, light, because since thanks to the warning of other yelpers I had appropriately lowered my expectations significantly, and can appreciate that I can get some steamed rice with lightly stir-fried or steamed veggies, and some meats that don't come with sauces, and platters of fresh fruits and berries in the morning.  You need a few light healthy meals while experimenting with all the amazing food options here, this isn't a bad place to make a pit stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention though that's also because we're staying here, and they've included 2 buffets for every night of our stay... else I may have a very different opinion at $29.99 a brunch.  On the bright side... no 2 hour lines either, just walk right in!  The deals on the Mandalay Bay website, highly recommend it if you're staying over the holidays and it'll at least get you a convenient meal for free.  One more meal here to go... I'll post pictures tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing worth mentioning is that the service is really friendly, and people are very nice here.  Will be back... tomorrow!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was pretty basic. We went for the $25 breakfast and the food was only ok. The real reason to go to this buffet is definitely the $5 bottomless champagne offer that they have! Since we were all a little hungover we just decided to stick with food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was ok. They had almost everything that you can imagine including fruit, bagels, smoked salmon, pancakes, eggs, bacon, omelette station, salad bar, Chinese food, sushi, carved meat, fresh seafood, muffins, cookies, pastries and more! If you are looking to eat a lot of mediocre food without breaking the bank then I would recommend. If you're a foodie, I would skip.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet USED to be a \"must try\" but now is just average. The service is average and quality is average.\n",
      "The per person price is definitely not the highest among other buffets. \n",
      "The wait is also not as long compared to a few years back (I visit LV almost every holiday). \n",
      "I did notice that over the years, they brought in more \"fillers\" like pastas, rice, etc. but what buffet hasn't taken that route?\n",
      "The dessert selection is still pretty good but that might just be my sweet tooth talkin. :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here was decent, though the selection for a vegas buffet was a bit underwhelming.  For the price though, $40 with tip for dinner, the selection is reasonable.  They had all the Vegas buffet staples, prime rib, shrimp, crab legs, etc.  Everything my group tried was good.  One bonus was that when we went on Valentine's day, they were serving complimentary champagne, wine, and beer.  The alcohol selection, however was not of very high quality.  The beer was bud light and the champagne was nothing to write home about.  For the price though, the return was reasonable.  Definitely worth it if you are not a foodie and are just looking to get your buffet on for under $50.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good buffet and I don't do buffets. Plenty of variety, the prime rib was perfectly seasoned and the cook working the omelet bar knew what he was doing. In my opinion the only room for improvement would be the desserts, I didn't have anything that wow-ed me.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a decent buffet but lacks the \"wow\" factor when it comes to presentation or varieties of foods offered.  Quality of prime roast was good and like many other Vegas buffets, had a decent selection of Asian dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ended up coming to bayside buffet as a last-minute decision. We were walking through the Mandalay Bay and we saw they had a good deal on the breakfast buffet with bottomless champagne. We figured why the heck we could give it a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "We walked in the house is very nice and set us quickly. The inside of the buffet was big not as big as some of the other Buffy is that I've been to but we were hungry so we definitely did the trick. We both got the bottomless champagne and I'm extremely sorry that I did because I ended up drinking at 9 AM and I ended up getting sick because I drink too much cheap champagne and I had to go to the room and lay down but that's my own fault. \n",
      "\n",
      "About the food so for breakfast they had all of the necessities that you would need eggs bacon sausage Hash. I found it interesting that even though we went for breakfast they still had lunch items out. You could still get chicken fingers cheeseburgers even had to stay carving station at 9 AM in the morning I was extremely impressed by that. You can get for lobster and crab legs at nine in the morning it was really interesting to see people actually getting crap legs at 9 o'clock in the morning. Their dessert station was fully open they had cheesecakes and pastries in all sorts of crazy desserts. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the taste of the food everything was fine I have no complaints the buffet was just your average run-of-the-mill buffet there was nothing special that set the Bayside buffet apart from some of the other buffet is that I've been to in Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the Bayside buffet was pretty good the bottom of champagne was a nice complement even know that I got sick but that is my own fault this buffet had everything that you would need to experience in a buffet although I would not say that it was the greatest or the most amazing buffet experience in Vegas that I have been to.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to a buffet experience I would def recommend coming here if not try one of the other buffets on the strip.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here on a Monday using the myVegas points for 2 for 1 for dinner. My wife and I arrived here early as possible since we know that there is going to be the dinner rush and they open at 4:30 pm. The surroundings is pleasant just like the hotel, the staff is kind, however the line was quite long because all the kiosk where down. If they had the kiosk operating, the wait wouldn't be that long. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we were seated, the waiter immediately requested our drinks and booked it to the crab legs since we basically went to the buffet just for them. The the endless crab legs hit the spot, specially with a side of melted butter! However the rest of the food were just okay. To summarize the rest of the selection is what you expect at a regular buffet.\n",
      "\n",
      "However with unlimited champagne and wine can't really go wrong. I would most likely go back only if I had a discount or some sort\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After a day of walking, the family and I came in here for some eats because why WOULDN'T you go to a buffet while in Vegas, right? :) \n",
      "\n",
      "The layout of this place was spacious and fancier than any other buffets I've been to. It was okay as far as food variety, and it all tasted fine. I think we came here close to dinner time, and I thought the cost was a little much. However, it included unlimited champagne so not a total bummer ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "If I was near by, I may come here again. However, I've been to a couple of other buffets where I enjoyed the variety more and would most likely pick over this one.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "bayside buffet is not in the same category as wynn or bellagio's. I would probably rank bayside with Mirage. Although i think Mirage is still better than bayside. \n",
      "I havent been to bayside buffet in a while, but from what i remember, their lunch buffet was not bad. it had a decent selection. \n",
      "of the times i went, i always request to sit by the window, where i can see their pool. It's nice to people watch. \n",
      "\n",
      "taste of their food, it was okay.. nothing spectacular. \n",
      "desserts werent great though.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Interior: pretty and clean. Not as pretty as the buffets like wynn but still ok. If you sit next to the windows, you get a nice view of the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exterior: inside of Mandalay Bay. Pretty nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service: not the best at all. There was two people working at the cashier and there was two lines that combined as one once you get to the front. So who goes first then? Well, common sense wise, customers should take turns like the family in the left line goes first, then the right side, then the left side. When it was my family's turn though, the family next to us rushed in front of us and the people at our line were annoyed at how the other family did that. When we finally got to the cashier, the woman's attitude was not the best. Won't complain much since it was dinner service and she must have been tired but still...? A little smile or something would have been ok but all we got was an annoyed tone. Water was refilled often so that as good. The friendliest people here were the chefs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: for the price, I would say it's not worth it. Places like wicked spoon or the buffet at wynn charges a high price for lots of food. This place charges a slightly cheaper price but for a less amount of food. Not much variety and the sushi are terrible. The salmon sushi had no crab meat. Only hard rice and a cucumber. The tuna was somehow almost dark purple instead of red. Other food were average. Limited amount of desserts too. I'm a huge dessert fan and I have to say, the desserts were not the best either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel and the chef at the buffet made the experience nice. But the overall food quality and first impression at the cashier line didn't leave the best mark for me.\n"

      "Hey, when thinking about buffets on the strip, most are about the same. Bayside was literally right in the middle. The selection was, of course, huge. Quality of food was spotty, but they literally had a little of everything. Not a particularly pretty restaurant, but they have unlimited beer\\/wine\\/champagne. At $35\\/person, it's not a bad deal if you're hungry and wanna get your drink on :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been to this buffet over a dozen times over the years, mainly due to having a local family member consider Mandalay Bay their home base.  I feel like I'm always a little bit underwhelmed.  Don't get me wrong, the food is very good, but I just feel that there should be more selection.  I mean, you only have two 'hot' buffet lines, and you have some overlap between the two.  I just think that if I didn't have my familial reasons (along with the partial comp and line pass), I would probably be able to find a better buffet that is priced a little better and has more variety.  Overall three stars, if on food quality only, closer to four.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm very disappointed at the bayside buffet at the Mandela bay.. I'm sure I didn't expected a lot but it's a Friday night (weekend  special menu?)and $ 33.00 values. Sometimes it's so hard to be crossed out my buffet BUCKET list. All buffet menu foods are \"look a like, tease a like\"... lol\n",
      "This place is not that busy, that means food will be dried out forever and turn around time will be ever.\n",
      "If you want to Las Vegas food experience, this is not a place recommend.  Unless if you are happens to be here and don't want to go out one more block whatever the reason or complementary buffet, maybe it just convenient..\n",
      "Desert section is dead!... seriously dead!  :(\n",
      "Overall, I will give this place 2.5 stars max.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The selection for the dinner buffet was pretty small and the food was just average. The servers were friendly and the all you can drink beer and wine was nice too. For a 30 dollar dinner buffet, the bayside buffet is just average.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good variety, mostly comfort food, nothing fancy, which may be good for those that don't like fancy cuisine. Kid friendly, good prime rib, coffee sucks.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The restaurant was all right.  I am only giving them a three-star because of their excellent customer service.  They were very attentive to our group (65 in total).  The food was meh...it was all right.  But the property is run down.  I mean the chairs are falling apart, the carpet was dirty, tables are peeling off.  I mean come on, the restaurant needs some type of renovation.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here for lunch. This buffet was alright. Nothing really stood out but it wasn't bad at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best item here was definitely the Prime rib and the crab legs. The prime rib was a perfect medium rare. It was super soft and tender. The crab legs were sweet and juicy. \n",
      "\n",
      "They surprisingly served breakfast items still (maybe it was brunch) such as bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, sausage, ham, and others. They also have sushi selection, carved turkey, fried chicken, pastas, mussels, shrimp, salad bar, fruit bar, and desserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the food was fresh and tasty. Good selection to choose from.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was in Vegas for a wedding and we had our \"rehearsal dinner\" the night before at the Bayside.  We didn't actually rehearse anything but that didn't stop us from stuffing our faces!\n",
      "\n",
      "The layout here is neat in that you never feel like you are in a huge crowded buffet, but it's not so mazelike that you can't find your way around.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually skipped the salad which is a first for me and went straight to the crab legs.  They were a bit difficult to eat with no tools at all but they were tasty, not overcooked and horrible like I expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all a decent buffet, and I hear they have the \"pay once, eat all day\" deal going on here if you want to stick around the Mandalay all day.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The prices here are good. Approx $20 per person. The food is okay. Its fresh and that matters most. I had the prime rip and it was nice and medium rare. The other dishes were not spectacular but better than simply edible. The service was good but the waitress thought we switched out a person. She asked my husband if he was the same guy that was sitting there a moment ago. I guess people try to cheat in these places but c'mon....It was over halfway through our meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I thought the waitress forgot my request for a steak knife (she didn't say anything about it when she was serving the table next to ours) she really didn't. It just took her a while. So I felt bad for mentally berating her for her ignoring my request.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert section was probably the best. Nice chewy cookies. I had an oatmeal cranberry one. They also had a really good peach cobbler that went excellent with vanilla frozen yogurt on top.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My friend and I decided on Mandalay Bay for the buffet, lines didn't appear long, and the price was decent for what you got at $33 per person. My friend praised the prime rib to the skies, and to my trained eye, it did look perfectly cooked. For myself, I found a decent selection of grilled and roasted veggies, some mediocre cream of mushroom soup, some decent desserts, and plenty of wine that I had just a bit of... decent wine, not the greatest, but a couple notches above two buck chuck. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was pretty good, refills came often, and plates cleared quickly. This buffet was just one of many I plan to try in the upcoming year, and it was by no means the worst, but there are likely more sumptuous buffets out there :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stopped by for lunch before going to the shark exhibit. It's nothing special your average Buffett style restaurant. The variety was the same Italian, BBQ, Asian and Mexican. The food  was good but not excellent and the service was typical of a buffet.  It was good to stop by but I am not sure if I will go back again....\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Been here a couple of times only because of MYVEGAS and resort credit. 2-1 lunch\\/dinner. It's ok. Not much selection, but it'll do when you don't have to pay full price.\n",

      "I don't even know why I bothered with the rest of the buffet.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Bayside has one of the nicest dining areas among the Strip buffets.  The food selection is average and is good quality.  Iced tea is NOT brewed (a big \"no no\" in my restaurant evaluation criteria).  Compromise on dessert quality if you need to cut corners but make sure you fresh brew the iced tea.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The best item on the day I visited was the prime rib.  It was tender, had nice flavor and was not bloody so you know they roasted it a while.  The food selection is not as vast as Bellagio, Wynn or M Resort but the price is commensurate with the selection.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was good even after the server shift change.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are ATM style kiosks at the beginning of the line to automate payments.  The user interface was simple.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Bayside is A-Ok 3 stars.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They have an omelet bar in the morning. The food is international from pot stickers to kielbasa sausage. The desserts are your typical cookies and little cakes. The coconut macaroons were good. The pot stickers were hard though. And some of the meat was not flavorful. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fruit is delicious and beautiful. They even serve pecans! The strawberries were a beautiful gemstone red.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's an okay buffet place that doesn't really have quality that can compare to the other vegas buffets.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I feel bad just giving this place 3 stars, because the selection was fantastic, both in terms of quantity and diversity.  Lots of delicious choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went in at lunch.  It wasn't dead, but wasn't swamped either, but it took us awhile to get any water with our meal.  I had to chase down a wait her to get some!  However, he was quite attentive to us after that and even brought us our own caraffe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that really pulls this buffet down to 3 stars for me was all of the seafood that I tried.  I tried the cioppino, the panko salmon, and some sushi rolls.  I am a seafood fan, but this fish tasted TOO fishy, to the point where I only took a bite of each.  I love sushi, but by no means am a sushi snob (I will even go to a higher quality conveyor belt place and enjoy it), and the bite I took of my roll here made me feel sick to my stomach.  Sushi, in my opinion, should NEVER have a strong \"fishy\" taste, but this sushi did.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you steer clear of the sushi, though, there is SO much to choose from, and all of it that I tried is fantastic!\n"

As with any buffet, nothing was amazing, but they had several fish alternatives, sushi that was made periodically throughout the day, prime rib that was cooked medium rare, salad bar, Mexican, Chinese, vegetables and a dessert bar. Plus tons more. In fact, I filled up my plate once and then saw a completely different section afterwards.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not the biggest buffet ever, but they have a good deal of seafood and it's pretty tasty. A solid 3 star here, which would be a 4 if the price was a little lower ($26 or $20 if you do the Shark exhibit, which I did)!\n",

There's a pasta bar, sushi (CA roll and salmon rolls), meat station, comfort foods, beer and wine, seafood, & Mexican station. The food was just ok but nothing spectacular. My favorite dish was the veal osso bucco & asparagus. Everything else was either really salty or lacked flavor. Service was fine but I didn't like how they sat us (party of 5) in a table for 4. I need room when I eat crab legs!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was ok, $23ish for brunch, no wait in line. Good selection of food. Decor wasn't anything to rave about, just a no frills buffet. Service wasn't great (hard to get someone's attention for drinks) but good worth worth the money and no wait.\n",

At $30 per person, the food was not bad at all. We got there at 12 and they still had breakfast items available as well as lunch and thanksgiving lunch items as well. The food was not excellent but was pretty good and I more than had my fill. The prime rib was so tender, though a little dry, but was still pretty good. All the food was hot and I could see the staff constantly checking the food temperature to make sure all was well. There was so much to choose from but I was able to try everything I wanted. They have a good selection though probably not as much as Bacchanal or the buffet at the Bellagio, but you'll definitely get your money's worth. The staff is attentive and always making sure our drinks were filled and tables cleared. Also there was no line to get in to the buffet. Give it a try if you don't feel like waiting at the other buffets. It's actually not bad at all.\n",

The prime rib was overcooked and seemed like it was last night's batch. The very middle of the rib roast was well done!! I probably came at a bad time.  The seafood is pretty decent here.  The Shrimp cocktail are of a very large size compared to Wynn and Bellagio.  The king crab legs (frozen..errr chilled) were split and of decent size as well.  I wouldnt' say they were as large as the ones at Wynn but good enough to enjoy.  The problem I had was that they over salted the legs so it was a little hard to eat.  I don't know if it was done on accident or just part of the preservation chemicals used on the legs.  Moving on, desserts were pretty crappy actually.  Nothing really looked good but taking a waffle cone filled to the top with ice cream was really great for the long walk back to my car!!  Everything else served is your standard buffet, breakfast stuff, pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc.  Nothing to write home about.  I do think for $23.99 you can get max value out of the buffet by just focusing...err \"enjoying\" the more expensive foods and the drinks.\n",

      "Eating at the Bayside Buffet is a \"hit-or-miss\" depending on the day and time. The last time I went, it was AMAZING. Our server was attentive, drinks always refilled and the food selection was exceptional. We had prime rib, freshly baked pizzas and extremely crispy fried chicken. After coming here numerous times, the salad bar hardly changes. I even found brown rice and whole grain pasta available (shocker, but I loved the healthy selection). Other times I went, the food was good and mostly fresh but the service was lacking. Drinks hardly got refilled and our server even walked by us and cleaned other tables not noticing that all 4 of us don't have any beverages. Another point of notice was that it wasn't even busy (defined as more than half the tables were vacant). Overall though, I love coming to Bayside Buffet. If the service was consistent, this would be one of Vegas's top buffets.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I thought it was well worth the price. The food was plentiful and good. Prime rib was delicious. You have to know what to pick from these places. The \"stuffed chicken leg\" was obviously store bought chicken cordon bleu. BBQ chicken pizza was excellent. I also like that beer, wine & champagne was included. Desserts were yummy. Overall, well worth the price. Also, if you're paying by credit card, use the self serve kiosks- HUGE time saver and super convenient.  The service was extremely attentive as well. I'd definitely return.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Buffet  $30 -packed as usual.  Nothing outstanding but something for everyone to hit the spot.  Crab legs were cold and just OK, prime rib was chewy but OK, the Chinese items were acceptable.

I went for dinner buffet and there was only the guy at the pasta place (which by the way was watery, not al dente and was bland despite the loads of sauce on it)\n",

Two stars for the food, one star for Lena, a beautiful waitress who was the best I have ever encountered at a buffet.

It was full of various pies, cake, puddings, soft serve ice cream, and cookies, both regular and sugar free. \n",

      "This buffet...in the land of buffets....is pretty standard. Hubby and I were able to walk in and be seated fairly quickly for dinner. The dishes they had weren't bad...but nothing really stuck out either. The carved station featured both prime rib and turkey. The prime rib was a bit overdone for my tastes...but it didn't have bad flavor. The turkey was pretty good and the hubby really loves turkey. (He was deprived turkey as a kid at Thanksgiving and other holidays...as his family doesn't like it, so he goes ga-ga for turkey) They did have king crab legs as well as snow crab...I of course went for the king crab and he surprised me and went for the snow crab. The king crab legs were kind of mushy...and just not very flavorful...kind of a bummer for me. He was busy cracking away at his snow crab...and offered me a bite of it. Wow...stand out of the evening! I shamelessly ditched my sad, tasteless plate of king crab legs...and bee-lined it to the snow crab. So sweet, so flavorful...really melt in your mouth goodness in a shell. After indulging in more snow crab than I probably should have, we perused the dessert section. They offered a ton of items including sugar free items...sadly nothing was remarkable. \n",
      "Service was kind of a miss for us that night. At first the hubby ordered pineapple juice and water...he got his water.....and it took 3 times of us asking for the pineapple juice before it finally arrived. I sat with empty water and soda for a while...but we noticed our poor server had the party from hell...(20 top.....with 15 kids) So we definitely cut him major slack for that and once we got refills and the pineapple juice the service kind of picked up...plates removed promptly enough given the circumstance. All in all it was just \"a-ok\" with only a few dishes being good-great and the rest kind of ....in the middle. I don't think we would return to this buffet only because the vast amount of food in Vegas...but it was cheap eats and a nice time with my guy.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had been here 7 years ago and it was one of my favorite buffets. It has gone downhill since then. Breakfast was pretty good though. A nice selection and the eggs made to order were yummy. I also liked that they had flavored syrups. Our server was on his game as well. We returned for lunch and I was disappointed. Too much seafood (I don't eat seafood) and not much of anything else. The deserts were sub par and the service was just ok. I would return for breakfast and that's about it.\n",

      "Most of the dishes were good - some of my favorites included the Prime Rib and Cheese Stuffed Blintzes.  The prime rib was a bit over cooked, but it had a ton of flavor; the blintzes were soft and the cheese had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.   The other items were a bit hit-or-miss, but over all a great deal ($23.00 for a champagne Sunday brunch).\n",

      "Decent standard buffet, not really any complaints! We went for breakfast since I had a MyVegas reward for it and got in very quickly. Our server brought our drinks out right away and was very friendly. The food was pretty standard but nothing was bad either. The layout was very strange though. For example, the entrees were not marked correctly and they had breakfast and lunch mixed together. Scrambled eggs were next to meat balls and I was so confused. The french toast, bacon, and fruit were great and I was left feeling full and satisfied so that's all that matters. Was it outstanding? No but it wasn't bad by any means.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I usually never go to buffets in Vegas however we got comped the buffet at the Mandalay so we basically had to go here. The food is mediocre. They also basically false advertise the prime rib. They don't always have prime rib, the day we went they had something called steamship. I had never heard of this cut of meat before but me as a surgical anatomist and an aspiring butcher I looked into it. Steamship is the top round cut of meat with the femur bone included. This is a lean, cheap primal cut of meat. This is very very different than prime rib. It still tasted good but it is not prime rib. The crab legs were salty and scrawny. Overall disappointing however most buffets disappoint me anyways.\n",

      "This buffet is pretty solid.  They don't have the GREATEST foods here but what they had exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a great selection here.  Decent carving station, asian foods, pasta cooking station, and salads.  I really liked the corn chowder here.  It was creamy and sweet-you could really taste the corn which I really enjoyed.  I mainly had a lot of veggies here bc I was overdosing on meat the entire weekend.  I liked the bak choy in the asian station, and the green beans & tomatoes were a nice side with my breaded chicken & cheese dish.  What I liked was the pasta cooking station.  I had bow tie pasta, with shrimp, onions, mushrooms, with a combination of their alfredo sauce & tomato sauce, topped off with fresh tomatoes.  This was actually pretty good and I couldve eaten the whole bowl had it not been one of the last things I went for.  Meat was OK.  Liked their rotisserie chicken & grilled steak.\n",

      "\n",
      "Anyway, I guess I wasn't in my buffet zone b\\/c I hardly ate anything. I had two pieces of braised beef (which was decent... tender and right flavoring), string beans with mushrooms and steamed rice (it was hard so that was eh...)\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked around waiting for food items to scream at me... \"pick me pick me\" but failed. I did go to the dessert bar and even that was eh. It was good, but not WOW. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I guess once you've had the best of buffets from the Bellagio and Wynn... there's no going back.\n",

We ate fish, snow crab legs, warm and cold; shrimp cocktail; prime rib; make your own pasta; Mexican food; tons of different options. The only real way to make up for having spent that much was the amount of crab we ate. I definitely think everyone ate $30 worth of crab. \n",

It has a smoky flavor that is unmatched. Try it topped with hoisin sauce and you could make a delicious meal out of just that. Otherwise, the MORE Buffet at Luxor is much better for variety and taste of food than this place. Generally, the food here is pretty generic. I admit I just go for the convenience when staying at Mandalay Bay...and that pork fried rice!  Plus the service here is always friendly and efficient bringing our drinks and removing used plates.\n"

      "\n",
      "1. Our server Ann was great. With her shout out to Hong Kong, and her constant smile with sense of humor, she was awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The prime rib was exactly that, prime rib. No need for sauce, or any condiments. It was great as is. Awesome flavor.\n",

      "3. The Asian salad was tasty and fresh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The flank steak was as dry as sandpaper used to clean up a Vegas strip\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dessert options were limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it was ok, we got our grub on, but was disappointed.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We at here twice during our week-long stay; once for brunch and once for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brunch - The brunch was pretty standard. Bacon, eggs, omelet station, waffles, pancakes, french toast, the usual suspects. It was pretty standard and nothing to write home about. I think they could consider two omelet stations though, the line gets pretty long and I didn't want to wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner - I felt this left a lot to be desired. The highlights include their version of cioppino, which had three different kinds of shrimp and imitation crab meat. The tomato broth was amazing. They also had snow crab legs, which if you take the time to add some of that to the cioppino, brings it up a level (but makes it colder). The low-lights were the prime rib, which was brown and way over done. The flank steak was tough and not flavorful. The pasta station didn't make any sense and didn't tell you what the options were. All of the bread\\/rolls were hard. Even the desserts were just ok. Their tiramisu was made it cute little chocolate cups but the lady fingers were soaked and soggy from the coffee at the bottom. \n",

      "\n",
      "This particular buffet is good. The brunch (which is what we came for) was decent enough. There were lots of breakfast options mixed with a good smattering of lunch dishes. Traditional breakfast things like eggs, french toast, breads, fruit dishes, & oatmeal can be found in abundance. They also had a number of seafood options including crab, sushi, and one other white fish which I thought was particularly unpleasant. There are also plenty of options in terms of desserts. The little tiramisu cups are a favorite. I was happy these seemed to be ubiquitous in Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is fun. I was particularly happy that this restaurant wasn't outfitted with a superfluous amount of gaudy flourishes or decorations. It was simple and to the point while still fitting with the resort-style feel of Mandalay Bay. \n",
      "\n",
      "The waitstaff was quite phenomenal. The lady who helped our table was funny, warm, and very amicable. I REALLY liked her. She was, without a doubt, the highlight of our experience here. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the price, there's plenty of food. If you're a vegetarian though, you're pretty much stuck with eggs, bread, and oatmeal (which I heard was very good, actually). For most, it's a great option if you're staying in the area and don't want to go far.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

For example, the potstickers were as expected but the rice dough was slightly too thick and they had been sitting awhile.\n",

Actually, that's a lie.  Their COOKIES-- mmmmmm... They're big and soft and oh so divine.  The white chocolate cherry is my favorite (whispers: I took some home).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decent buffet for the price.  Priced better then upscale bellagio or the wynn with similar foods.  The drawback is drop in quality is noticeable.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's either this place, or Circus Circus if you want a reasonably priced buffet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I enjoyed myself. It's not like buffet food is everything you've ever hoped for and more. But it's definitely one of the better spots to go, so if you don't want to spend $30, this $23 buffet brunch (on Sundays, Mimosa's included!.... endless mimosas... insane) is totally worth it. \n",

      "I will give the Lox and Cream Cheese section 4 stars. I filled up two plates with that stuff. Worth the price of admission alone!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "There are a TON of different options here for breakfast and brunch. Any breakfast food you can think of and tons of lunch options if you are leaving that way. While there were a lot of choices, the taste of food wasn't the best. There were a lot of things that looked good, but just weren't satisfying. I would however take advantage of the bottomless champagne on the weekends. The servers are very good about topping off your glasses so you get your money's worth. I would recommend this buffet over a regular casino restaurant because it costs the same but you get more food.\n"

I had to serve myself and get the straws from another waitress.  The food was spread in 2 sections for breakfast. The 2 areas were similar by 75% with the same foods and differed by 25% with a different in choices. Meaning while both sides had eggs, waffles, and pancakes. One side had ham and steak while the other had blackberry pancakes and  mexican food.  Not that many variation in foods. only go if you and\\/or another person want to eat free.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A solid average buffet in Vegas. Decent selections although I found some food was borderline cold. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. I was satisfied overall but it wasn't something to write home about.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "FOOD: A-ok food. Ox tail was good. Chicken noodle soup had no chicken and no noodles! Broth was good I admit but only had celery and carrots. Mashed potatoes tasted weird I would pass on that. Corn on Cobb tasted very watery overcooked. \n",

      "DESSERTS: Desserts we're ok they have some sugar free options and soft serve frozen yogurt machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAYMENT: Best part was when you walk in you can pay with credit card at a self serve kiosk! What a great idea to help make the line move faster. We were there it had no line so I'm sure the kiosks helped with that. You can choose to add tip when you pay or choose to leave tip at the table. \n",

      "STAFF: Staff come by and clear away your plates in a timely manner so your table stays clean for the most part.\n",

      "\n",

      "Really nothing more than average at best. The selection wasn't phenomenal and the food was just your average buffet. I did like the carnitas and sausage, but there was nothing special about this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's $15 for breakfast and $20 for lunch. Not one of the more expensive buffets, but if we didn't get comped, it's not a place I'd return to.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really good variety of food. Prime rib, crab legs, sushi. Plenty of good stuff. That being said, I started having some GI issues a couple of hours later. Was it the food there or something else? Also ate at Wicked Spoon. This is a decent buffet. Our server was really good so I added the extra star\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The buffet is fairly expensive but, I actually liked this place while in Vegas. I stayed at the Mandalay Bay and went for breakfast ($17.99) and dinner ($35.00) both during the week. Fresh made to order omelets in the morning and of course, prime rib at night. The wait staff was very friendly and kept our table clear of dirty dishes. Pretty good variety of food to choose from but was surprised they didn't have my favorite french dressing for salads. Other than that, my only other complaint was the prime rib being extremely too rare for my taste. The quality of the food was fairly decent, and the ambiance was pleasant. Despite the negative reviews, I'd definitely come back when I'm in town, again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet is OK -- but nothing special at all.  We ate here because we had a resort credit to spend, but wouldn't have otherwise gone here.  Not much more to say.\n"

Staff was polite and our dishes were cleared quickly. Their food just seemed mediocre. I usually love desserts, but I only picked a few and I wasn't too excited. I would come back using MyVegas, probably wouldn't pay for it though.\n",

      "The french toast, sausage, most desserts, orange juice, and coffee were excellent. Their eggs were gross, especially the \"cheesy\" ones. They have an omelette station that I wish I went for.. From all the great reviews, I did expect better quality food, but it was all mediocre and some foods didn't taste that fresh (which is expected from a buffet). I spent a good chunk of the morning on the toilet after this meal... I don't think I'll be back.\n",

      "As a general rule I like to hit the buffet when I go to Vegas. There are good ones and there are bad ones. Personally I think this is one was good and bad. I actually ended up coming here twice for two reasons: the crab legs and the butterscotch cookies. \n",

      "First Visit:\n",
      "I came closer to 8:00 to avoid the ridiculous line that forms around 6:00. i got through the line pretty quick but the visit started out shaky. The hostess told me that a sever would take my drink order. So I waited at my table for my drink order and a woman comes up tells me her name and literally throws my straw at me and asks me if i wanted a drink. She seemed to very irritated. I sat there shocked and I noticed that a couple sitting in a table across stared and sat their open mouthed shocked as well by how rude she was. I asked for a Pepsi and she went on her way. After she left the woman from the other table said \"well I guess you are going to get the same service as us.\" Apparently she was rude to them too. Honestly, I could care less after i got my drink. I thought i did not really need her for anything else. As i went to help myself to the food I saw there was quite a variety of different foods. They had Mexican, Spanish, Asian, Italian, salad, soups, prime rib, and best of all crab legs! of course I made a beeline for the crab legs. I grabbed some and some salad for my first place. The crab legs were great! The meat was tender and good. I was trying to crack the legs myself by breaking them in half with my hands when my lovely waitress ran by and dropped a crab leg cracker at my table. After that she was totally different toward me. So attentive and nice. It was like a different person. I don;t know, my guess is because I did not really ask her for anything but a drink in the beginning? Don;t really know. But when I went for a second plate I helped myself to more crab legs and some fried rice and a pizza slice. The pizza was ok and the fried rice was gross. I really liked the crab legs though. now for dessert. I went and grabbed some butterscotch cookies that just looked good and they were the best cookies I have ever eaten. I eve took some with me! LOL. I know that is bad but they were that good. The ice cream sucked. Honestly by the time I left I was more than satisfied with the crab legs and butterscotch cookies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second Visit:\n",
      "Much longer line this time probably cause it was Christmas. I don't know I wanted to try the prime rib this time so I decided to go back on whim. Having more butterscotch cookies as a holiday treat could not hurt either. The line was long but once I got in and seated it wasn't bad. Got my drink pretty quickly. Went and grabbed some prime rib and crab legs first. The prime rib was just ok, Nothing to write home about, I grabbed more crab legs and after that went for the butterscotch cookies. They were just as amazing as last time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, with the exception of the crab legs and butterscotch cookies everything was either looked kinda gross or was gross. I don't think I would advise someone to spend $30 just to try a couple of things. Go for it if you want to. I might go back I might not. I mean the crab legs suffice as a good meal for me.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Their coffee soo good. I'd kill to get it again. Is there one around LA?!\n",
      "Raisin, white chocolate cookies I can't stop eating them\n",
      "Their dessert was a killer that put me over the top. You must save room for dessert because once you get to it with their delicious coffee it's hard to stop.\n",

Costco is the best in providing delicious king crab legs. Caesar comes near second providing king size Dungeness crab claws. Since I'm in LA I go to Redondo pier to get my steamed Dungeness crab claws :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Wonderful burgers,  excellent onion rings, good service.  Just don't order dessert.  We ordered apple cobbler and was served blueberry bread pudding.  When we questioned if it was apple cobbler our waited assured us it was cobbler. After we ate a few bites... no apple! The waitress told us she has been waiting for a customer to question it.  We still were charged the full $7.00 for a dessert we didn't order or want! Too bad the rest of the meal was great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Visited for Restaurant Week so we had a shared app (crab cake), two entrees (Carolina burger w\\/string fries and fish and \"chips\"\\/string fries) and shared dessert. The waiter was friendly but somewhat unattentive and tried to push the other restaurants\\/deli on to us quite a bit. The food was pretty mediocre but edible..no complaints. I'm not a huge string fry fan so I was hoping for some thicker cut \"chips\". The blueberry bread pudding was okay. It tasted like they used old garlic bread from the other restaurant next door then smothered it in whiskey and butter. We went about 15-20 minutes without a water refill and waited 10 minutes for our card to be picked up. All in all it was just okay but at least now we know and it only cost us $30. I guess that's what Restaurant Week is all about though right?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Was here on a business lunch with a colleague.  I had the Arizona burger.  The bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger, and while good in theory, was ok at best.  Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was the second time I have come to charr. The restaurant is really cool and appealing to the eye. The food is really really good. I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich and on this trip I had the Carolina burger. The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Although happy to find another decent place to eat in the Lovely's hood, this was not a 5 star experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the number of families we saw in there, this does not read as kid friendly. I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up. \n",
      "\n",
      "My flat iron salad had freshly cut romaine, homemade croutons, some bermuda onion, corn and black beans and a slice of tomato that was cut in half. I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with a good portion of sliced flatiron steak that although cooked well, had zero seasoning and the dressing on the side was described as a southwest caesar. I didn't get southwest and I did get blah\\/lacking in flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line, we'd go back but for the burgers only. Cost of the meal for three of us with no drinks, only water, was $40. Its nice that its in the hood and that there is good food but overall it was good, not great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My husband enjoyed his Hawaiian burger.  The barbeque burger was Ok except the barbeque sauce was very sweet.  The server was good but was very touchy feely and kept calling me pet names like \"babe\" and \"sweetheart\" which made me uncomfortable since he was at least 15 years younger than I am.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My wife and I visited Charr with a couple friends for restaurant week this week. We sat out front and waited for our waiter to take our drink orders... And waited... And waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I am giving 3 stars is the food. The Carolina burger was delicious... The sauce and bacon were savory, the garlic knot bun was perfect. Their fries were great and they give you plenty of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend this place for the food, but expect to wait for it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good burger, found this place on IDine.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Easy location. I only wish they were open and delivered at lunch time. The food is very good. I had the 5 cheese sandwich, a cheese lovers dream, and the housemade onion rings. I had ordered a diet coke which was flat. They could not fix it, so I just drank water. The wait staff was friendly, but kind of slow. I thought it was very, very pricey for what you get. The food was very good. I guess it comes down to what are you tradeoffs for good food?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Service good. Atmosphere good. Burgers...to die for. Shrimp Po Boy, overlooked and plain.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was okay... First off, this place is in a strip mall - not the kind of place you expect to be asked \"do you have reservations?\" I think there is a little mismatch here. The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams \"American Bistro\" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local\\/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not \"the check\"), we got everyone's tab on it! WHat a nightmare. The server, who had been inattentive or disorganized all night never got better (hint: you will improve your tips if you don't call the men \"buddy\" and \"bro\" and if you don't call the women \"sweetie.\" Frankly, \"Sir\" and \"Ma'am\" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and \"truffle fries?\" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger.\n",
      "I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good.\n",
      "Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project.\n"

      "To the food, Nicholas order their signature burger, and we split their mac and cheese... which was absolutely amazing! It's definitely not the best I had, but close enough.. and I highly recommend it.  I also order some wings which was okay, they were really tough to chew. \n",

      "The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, \"So you don't make exceptions.\" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, \"Don't come back.\" \n",
      "Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, \"sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good. \n",
      "The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.)\n",
      "I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business.\n",

      "When we sat down for our meal it took some time for our server to get to us. She came to us and asked if we had been helped since we already had drinks. I guess the hostess didn't inform her?  We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek..\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "This is the 2nd time being here and the first was okay, I just got a grilled cheese but my friend got a burger and she said it was overcooked. This time I ordered a burger and she got steak sandwich, we both ordered medium rare...I thought that means pink in the middle...well, they both came out well done. Granted they tasted fine, but when you prefer your meat cooked a certain way, you'd hope it is. If you order, order well below how you like your meat, it will likely come out more done then expected. I guess next time I will ask they don't even kill the cow, just embarrass it =-p\n",

      "My husband and I went to Charr a few weeks ago.  I purposefully waited to write this since we wanted to re-try a couple of other places nearby for comparison.  We had 2 wedge salads, 2 burgers, an order of onion rings and 3 beers.  $60.  In the next two weeks we went to a nearby sports bar\\/Italian place and a brewpub.  For similar quantities, the price was $35 at one place and $38 at the other, both similar quality.  I have a hard time justifying the higher price tag, especially considering how loud it was at Charr, it was difficult to have a conversation.  The beer selection is good, but overpriced as was the case with everything.  Doing a la carte will be a tough sell when that is not what everyone else does.  We may return but not often unless the value gets better.  I wish them well but would encourage them to consider some changes that will price them more competitively.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ate there last night. Place should be great with nice surroundings, quality ingredients, and diverse menu. Restaurant failed at the two key places. A brand new server who was slow and inefficient was irritating, but the real sin was over cooking the burgers. 4 people at the table ordered medium and 1 was served medium and 3 well done.  I assume the beef was as high quality as everything else, but I had no way to tell with meat that over cooked.\n",

      "Much-needed upscale place in Moon Valley.  Cheated on my standard, Ammacapanne's, 3 times to try this place.  Much better fare, but much worse service.  This most recent visit, the hostess seated us and I asked for a reminder on what the WiFi password was (I'm not a total douche...my wife and I run a small biz together and commonly work over meals and drinks).  The hostess kinda curtly said she didn't know if the place even has WiFi (I knew it did) and didn't know the password if it did.   No effort to go get it.  Finally waited for a server, who vaguely thought she knew it.  I'm not in the HRM industry, except as a consumer, but I can't imagine not training my staff on this.  Love the ambiance and food. Just disappointing service in my 3 visits.\n",

      "Bryan had the green chili burger while I had the pizza burger. We decided to order different ones so we could split and try both. The buns are actually garlic knots or something similar, but they are shaped like cinnabons in which the dough is spiraled all the way to the center. Unique fun idea but man, does this make for a horribly messy burger. You are forced to gobble up the burgers very quickly so they don't fall apart on you. The pizza burger was good, but I liked the chili one more just because there was more flavor to it. It's not that spicy either, so if you're afraid of spice, you are safe to order this chili one. \n",

      "The restaurant and bar are very nice. I loved the dark woods and back lighting. The place is alot more trendy and fun in comparison to the rustic, yet charming older restaurant on Central Avenue close to Camelback. I'm hoping for this place to be a success, but I feel like there are a few more \"things\" that need to be worked out. Even if their burgers are just okay to most people it seems (after reading several previous reviews), let me assure you that their regular Italian food is their specialty and what they're amazing at!\n",

Who would have imagined that $10+ for a cheeseburger would be a good deal??\n",

There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it.\n",

Credits do cost money it's not like we were on some play for so many hours thing. Things were pretty cool from there until we got to the giant fish reel. The reel says we won 70 tickets awesome, the box even says we were awarded 70. So of course since 70 is a lot lets play again. This time the giant reel says we won 60 tickets! Child is super excited and I look down at the box and it says 15 tickets awarded. WHAT?! So I got robbed of 9 credits and at least 45 tickets. Never thought to watch any of the other times we won tickets so who knows how many Game Works really stole from us. It was over all a good time, just left a bad feeling knowing we got ripped off.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had lots of fun here And I truly felt like a kid again! The things that bugged me is that it is very pricey and the tickets compared to the prizes is very expensive! Something I can purchase at the store for maybe $10 cost 1000 tickets or maybe $50 of hard work gaining the tickets. So with that being said if you are in it for the fun and ready to spend lots of money then have at it! The service though was great!\n",

But they need to staff accordingly!!!!! Not as many games as the previous GAMEWORKS in Vegas. The bathrooms were a little dirty as well. I would come back to see if this would change.\n"

I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!! \n",

Although the food is ok, just ok, I had the pizza, it was about the same price as one you could get at CPK, and not nearly as good. But still a fun place and they have a decent happy hour.

      "\n",
      "I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.\n",

      "The location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gameworks. When you hear that it should sound like a dream to everyone. The former Gamewirks that was on the Strip was a wonderful attraction. It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new \"Recharge Center\" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games.\n",

      "\n",
      "The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.\n",

      "I want to give this a five star rating based on the games but I can't since their food is awful! I got very sick after eating their nachos. 7\\/11 has better nachos then here. My husband ordered the wings. They were over cooked and were frozen before being cooked. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I chuckled when I saw that this place is categorized on Yelp under \"Gastropubs.\" That's pretty generous.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that's always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as \"ground steak\" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13\\/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16\") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine.\n"

Those brought back memories of going to the carnival when I was little. My teenage son  decided to go the gaming section which features online computer role playing. the price at 5 per hour seemed very reasonable.  Decided to have lunch at the restaurant. It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people. \n",

I've seen nothing new except the bowling and they have billards.  It looked similar to Insert Coins.  Because they have a bar and gaming consoles for you to play on too.  I didn't like the new payment method where you have to get a prepaid card to swipe to play a game.  I like the old fashion pay with quarters.  I like they have an internet cafe where you can LAN party with your friends.  All in all, it's not that bad.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "GameWorks is still the same GameWorks that was on the Strip. The prices are high, the games race car and shooter centric. The kids had a blast running around and playing the games. The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad.\n",

      "Come here on a weekday! It's a lot less crowded and the service is a bit better. We decided to take my niece and nephew here on a Saturday night and it was really packed. We wanted to get the unlimited game card but you have to dine in to get the deal. I really wish they would just sell the cards without meals coz we didn't really want to eat there. We had to so we did. We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper. She took our name down and our number and said they'll call when a table was ready. So we walk around outside for a bit and when the 30 minutes was up we came back and checked in with the hostess. We waited another 10 minutes then we were finally sat. It seemed like they were short on people. We were sat for quite a bit when a manager finally took our order. The food was ok. We got the nachos and pizza. After that whole process, we finally got our game cards so the kids could play. Nearly all the machines and games were in use. You kind of had to stand by the game you wanted to play and wait for whoever was using it to finish so you can play it next for sure. There was a good selection of games for the small space. I think the kids had fun in the end but they were miserable having to wait for the restaurant and the food and that whole process of getting the game card.\n",

After 10 minutes I realized they would be out of money real quick SO I inquired on the food and play option ($15 for an hour with one food item or $22 for 2 hrs and one food item) . You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn't just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour\\/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect \"tickets\" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food. \n",
      "The \"prizes\" are ok. I like that you can save the card and continue to save the points.\n",

      "Pretty neat place. Arcade, bar, bowling, and even karaoke all in one. Only downside tons of children and teenagers everywhere. My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "While this is a more convenient location than the original Game Works it does somewhat lack the content and size of the strip location. I can't help but compare any venue of the type to Dave & Busters of which there is no comparison. We came for Birthday party, they did do a good job and our server Mike was outstanding. But $11 for six slices of pizza is a bit much as we had to buy over six pizzas to feed 10 hungry teens. Buy the size of the crowd its nice to see Game Works doing well but they could reduce the dinning area to accommodate more gaming space as it was only half full at best on a Saturday night. Overall we had good time.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games. \n",

      "Opening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet. \n",
      "Now, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~! \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!\n"

      "So always been fan of the concept of GameWorks since I visited one in Seattle years ago. The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar\\/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. \n",
      "\n",

      "If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks.\n",

      "We arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table. \n",

      "I didn't mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn't get our water\\/beverages till after.

What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards. \n",

      "I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all. \n",
      "\n",
      "BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more \"prizes\" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered\\/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well. \n",

That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. \n",
      "\n",
      "They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Centipede\", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most \"little\" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play \"Call of Duty\" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!\n",

      "Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by \"Barcade\" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, \"One Moscow Mule please\". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. \n",

      "All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.\n",

I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were \"out of service\". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design. Very poor as a game fun center..didn't make it fun! Boo..bring a dave n busters!!!!!!!!\n",

      "I can't give an all too extensive review because we were mostly secluded in the billiards area of the main bar (by the entry way). It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for \"The Color of Money\" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we'd have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an 'okay' experience for a limited one.\n",

      "I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!\n",

I wish all the games gave tickets so they would actually play games besides ticket machines! A lot of machines were out of order. There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds. No matter how the adults feel, this is heaven for kids!\n",

Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

I always think \"hey lets go to gameworks\" and then I realize how bad it is everytime hahaha. Granted I hate chuck e cheese but it's way better as far as games go it also feels more liberating with actual tickets in your hand. I do prefer the people at gameworks VS chuck e cheese because it's flooded with little kids. Anyways Gameworks is ok... I guess lol\n",

      "Great place for kid's parties. I recently attended one, where the family rented out a large room that had plenty of space for guests and tables full of pizza, wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and bruchetta. The food wasn't anything special, but that's to be expected from a place that focuses on games and entertainment. The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times.\n",

      "This is a great place for kids of all ages to play a wide variety of arcade games, ranging from high-end video games (sit inside of a capsule, with wrap-around screens) right down to those silly games you find at other venues that spit out paper tickets you can redeem for nearly worthless prizes.  Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!\n",

      "If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.\n",

I ended up wasting 20 bucks playing low quality and overrated games for little kids. I was more interested into the eSports games, which is near the back of Gameworks. eSports interests Pre-Teens and up. eSports has a Wii U for Smash Bros and Mario Kart 8, XBox for Mortal Kombat X and Minecraft, PS4 for Call of Duty or Counter Strike Global Offensive, and a computer that can download any playable game for free. It's very cheap for 1 hour, 5 bucks. I look forward to playing MK8 and SSB4.\n",

You're able to reserve for parties which makes it perfect for groups and birthdays. If you're a hard core gamer this might not be the arcade for you since the selection of games is limited.

The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything. \n",

However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones.

Gneerally some of their staff needs to improve on their attitudes towards their customers. I get that it's a SUnday afternoon and you are busy, but there is no need to roll your eyes at your customers, especially when we as a large group already agreed to splitting up in order for her to seat us easier (yes i'm talking about the hostess).

The prices are cheap here and food is ok, not great, but you really can't expect much for the price you pay. They offer lots of dim sum choices too but why get frozen dim sum from here, when you can buy some from T & T and steam it yourself. \n",

The menu offers a variety of choices, from individual items to set meals for larger groups.  They also have lunch and dinner specials for a good price.

I was most excited for the fried rice, but it ended up being pretty bland and overall disappointing.  The curry was tasty, but I didn't have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent.  The other noodle dishes were good, but nothing amazing.  We ended off the meal with a dessert of green bean soup, which was quite tasty.\n",

If the fact that it's owned by the guy who owns Ming's (another popular HK cafe south of Pacific mall) doesn't peak your interest, then maybe the thousands of dollars of expensive iron man figures will? No? Well let's talk about the food: it's typical hk style level. I tried two breakfast specials for the sake of this review - luncheon meat instant noodles and corn beef egg sandwich with oatmeal. Both are average in taste and portions. But for $6 each what do you expect? Fast, efficient, service with economical typical dishes.

In my opinion, when a restaurateur aims at a certain market, whether the restaurant is good depends on whether it delivers delicious food in a hygienic environment, and fulfils the expectation\\/norm of that market.  If it exceeds expectation, great, but IMO, \"good\" only requires meeting expectation.  Maybe my expectation of a HK cafe is not particularly demanding.  Maybe I have missed the poorly reviewed period of the grand opening.  During the first visit recently (in 2016), I find Kitchen M meeting expectation of a HK cafe..

The salad was a little drenched in a pool of oil with some balsamic.  The Antipasti was good.  Tuscan burger was amazing. I thought the service was a little to be desired.  Reason being is that we had to ask for drink refills.  Also when I was looking to leave I had to take the bill up as our server was busy chatting it up with another table.  Maybe I'm just being picky but we were in a rush to leave!  For the price I expect a bit better service!\n",

The place felt very warm as we walk into the restaurant with the bar area on one side that is partition very well from the main the dining room.  With 8 of us, its always hard to find a place with a variety of dishes to choose from.  Fraticelli's definitely has a big selection of pasta, pizza, ravioli and steak.  Unfortunately my sister was looking forward to ordering the lobster ravioli as it was on the website but it was not available at this location (maybe not in season).\n",

He walked us in, saw it was set for 7 (we had a party of 5), and had us wait in the dining area.  Awkward.  He came back only to tell us that it was, indeed, our table.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The next awkward moment was when a different server came to ask us if everything was alright (as we were about to leave through the front doors) because we didn't leave a tip.  Since we used a particular coupon, it stated gratuity would be included in the final amount, and it was 18%.  We had to point out the gratuity amount on the bill was charged already and then we left.  This might've rubbed some people the wrong way.  \n",

The food isn't anything more than pub fare but it gets the job done. Live music and great views make for a nice evening. And the crowd was pretty small so you had the pick of the tables for sure. Definitely worth a trip on HH Thursdays. A nice change from your typical pub early evening out and a great way to begin Thirsty Thursday.\n",

Lately I've been hooked on their  Angus burger, its loaded w\\/ your choice of cheese, 2 thick slices of bacon along w\\/ lettuce & tomato.  Its pretty filling plus all their sandwiches come w\\/ french fries, sweet potato tots or chips.  My hubby likes their turkey wrap and my son loves their kid's cheese pizza, it comes out piping hot so be careful w\\/ your lil ones.  Our total this afternoon, w\\/ our 10% member discount came to ~$27 including 2 Honest Teas and a kids drink, which comes w\\/ the kid's meal.  For fast casual the food is pretty darn good and priced very reasonably.\n",

      "Most of us have gone to a theme park and been greatly disappointed by the food services.  Usually prepackaged, microwaved fare or fast food level, or super pricey)   Even the great San Diego Zoo has mediocre food for the most part (although if you search they do have some gems).  So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the Springs Cafe which offers well prepared, gourmet style lunches and entrees at reasonable prices.  I had a ceviche salad that was excellent.  The hamburgers were great and the sides excellent.  The sundays were tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't a gourmet location though and the service is underwhelming, the ambiance mediocre. In fact the service was very poor, they tried to bring our deserts (we got free sundays with the coupon on the flyer) at the same time as the meal. Then when we got them to understand we wanted them to wait on delivery, they got mixed up as to how many we ordered.  Also the food takes a while.  But the food is worth it and even the picky eaters I was with enjoyed their meal without complaints, not an easy task.\n",

This was delicate, cooked perfectly and had amazing smokey flavor.  It honestly was just perfect.  The view from the deck overlooking LasVegas was the final touch.  I will be back in a few weeks for work and will becoming by here for a nice lunch.  \n",

      "We split a vegan burger, which they thoughtfully cut in two and served on two plates with tomato, lettuce, 2 pickle spears, french fries,and a scoop each of quinoa salad. When we requested hot sauce our waiter brought two different kinds, then brought a grilled jalapeno pepper to boot! The manager stopped by to ask about our experience. We were among the earlier customers the day we went; lunch crowd was only starting to come in.\n",

For example I bought a turkey wrap  (cut into 3 small slices) for $8.50. & a small kids pizza that my kids shared for $5. + $3 for a refillable drink. I really expected bigger, but overall the taste quality wise was good. My wrap was delicious with a hint of spice and red peppers. + fries. We sat on the balcony & ate & it was a nice experience. I will be back. =)\n",

We ordered the Monte Cristo, Portallo mushroom panini with a side of broccoli cheddar soup, and the BBQ chicken salad. The spin on the Monte Cristo resembled a breakfast French toast with ham. Very good. The panini has a nice helping of provolone for the cheese lovers! That, with the mushroom and grilled zucchini and bell peppers... nom, nom, so good! Also, has outside seating overlooking the springs and a strip view.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here is tasty and well prepared, a relief with kids in tow.  Just not that many items on their menu.  I say this because I expect overpriced pre-packaged food from museum cafes.  However, it seems to be very well run with a manager who oversees the preparation of the food.  The menu is simple and the staff very friendly.  I love the view from this location of the preserves, as well as, the Strip, most specifically you can see the Stratosphere.  I forget I'm in Vegas!  For what you get, the food is great. Don't hesitate coming here if you're visiting the Spring Preserves.  Of course the prices will be inflated but they're not outrageous.\n",

And because the morning was nothing short of perfection, we sat outside on the veranda -- the outdoor seating area is large, overlooks the preserve, and has a fabulous view of the city.\n",

      "\n",
      "The cafe\\/venue itself deserves 5 stars all on its own because it is very large and can accommodate large parties, families, or intimate dates inside OR outside.  Outdoor seating would be my preference because it provides a panoramic view of Las Vegas.  You can see downtown as well as the Strip.  However, the indoors gives off a rustic vibe with doors and windows that still have access to that beautiful view.  There's also live music inside which, in my opinion, is uncommon in this city.  For all those reasons, this place is worth a visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their happy hour menu is very limited, but has just enough variety.  They have their own cocktail drinks, a nice selection of bottled beers, and wine.  I was most impressed by the food portions.  We ordered nachos, calamari, and the date flatbread.  I thought they would be tapas style, and boy was I wrong.  The portions were very generous, and for the price, they're almost a steal considering the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Food was great, but my favorite was the bacon and date flatbread.\n",

      "I haven't been here in a couple years since it was Wolfgang Puck's restaurant and even though it was good, it was pricey for what I wanted. I noticed this time around, it changed names and it took some convincing from my hungry boyfriend to just eat here while on our Springs Preserve date than venture off campus. That being said:\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the chicken pesto pizza $10 and a burger (boyfriend never mentioned the name) $9-10 ordered medium rare. The views are beautiful and so relaxing with their floor to ceiling windows overlooking Springs Preserve and the Vegas skyline from the northwestern perspective. Food didn't take long and they brought it to the table. My pizza was definitely not just a personal size. It's good enough for two super hungry people or three people snacking. DELICIOUS. The oils from the cheese were everywhere and when you pull the slice, it had that glorious stretch of soft fresh cheese...the way pizza was meant to be. Johnny's burger was pretty good, better than I would expect. It looked like a gourmet burger with a half pound or so patty cooked medium rare with its juices still intact on a brioche bun. All the condiments you need are already on the table including hot sauces. Oh, and the fountain drinks include a dispenser of water infused with mint and sliced strawberries. With  a squeeze of lemon, it was amazingly refreshing and tasteful for the hot summer day.\n",

Have tried the burger, wedge salad with chicken, Cuban sandwich, chicken sandwich & Hawaiian teriyaki bowl. All good, fresh food & good portions. I have brought a few friends here who hadn't eaten at the cafe before & they were all pleasantly surprised.

One of the healthier kids combos we've seen in a while. Our kid loved it.  I had a glass of their Chardonnay, which was fruity and crisp. My husband had their Lager on draft.. Refreshing\n",

Because of this, my husband didn't really easy much of it. We enjoyed the food though, the service was fast and polite. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Every year I have a tradition of hiking the trails of the Springs Preserve when ghosts, goblins, wicked pumpkins, and other haunted creatures adorn the park. I never got to experience the nightime Haunted Harvest. Knowing that I was going to be in the park all day, I decided to have lunch in the park's Divine Cafe. \n",
      "\n",
      "   My expectations of theme park \\/cultural center food is convenience over quality. However, Divine Cafe exceeded my expectations. It wasn't really a shock because I had been there before to enjoy a beverage. The restaurant did have a positive vibe. Heidi Knapp Rinella in her September 25, 2014 Review Journal article \"Springs Preserve's Divine Cafe True to its Name\" says it best:\n",
      "\n",
      "       \"The Springs Preserve doesn't have to have\n",
      "        a cafe. But, like the preserve, it sure makes\n",
      "        life a lot nicer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  As soon as you exit the elevator or climb the steps above the gift shop, you enter a divine space. Your eyes immediately overlook the counter and football field of tables, chairs, and even sofas toward the glass walls with one of the most divine views in Las Vegas. This is a divine vista including a panorama of the Downtown Las Vegas skyline with the Stratosphere and Las Vegas Strip skyline framing the open spaces of dessert and wetlands. When it comes to eating with a view, Divine Cafe is a jackpot. The two places to enjoy the view are from inside and the patio. The inside is like a glass house where many tables are front row.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ordering is relatively easy. There are menus outside and at the entrance. I ordered the burger with fries and a fountain beverage. After a Yelp check-in offer for a free beverage with an entree it came to less than $11. The burger was made of the finest ingredients. This was a thick burger with tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and provolone cheese. The fries were plentiful and flavorful. The bottomless cola was refreshing. The condiments on the table made dining a better experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "  I was impressed with the service. Immediately the friendly lady greeted me when I walked inside. When I asked if the burger included cheese, she mentioned the four choices the menu omitted. She happily accepted my Yelp check in offer. Minutes after I put my number on the table, a friendly man brought my food to the table. He also cleaned up the plate. Another aspect of good customer service is confidence that no funny stuff is going on with my food. Divine Cafe has an open kitchen where I could see my food being made. Likewise, I know that it is being freshly made. On another note, Divine Cafe is especially clean. To my olfactory scent, the bathroom smelled more like the scented air in the Aria than a public restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Just like Springs Preserves, Divine Cafe provides a terrific experience at a great price. I was very impressed. Hopefully one day I could make their Thursday Happy Hour and take in the sun going down over the panoramic vista of Downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe I'll return for their new weekend brunch. Until then, I will reward Divine Cafe with a review of four stars that says \"I'm impressed! \n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Lots of parking, but may be crowded on some days.  No need to pay the park entrance fee to eat at the cafe.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Wonderful view of the city and the park.  Inside and outside dining.  The food is pretty good.  Employees are friendly.  The manager dropped by to check on things and say hello.  Prices are a little high, but not bad.  Daily specials are served in a bento box.  The menu is designed with sustainability in mind.  Busy lunch crowd.  My favorite part of this experience is the atmosphere.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We really enjoyed our lunch here. I'm between four and 5 stars. Its located in the springs preserve. On the second story with a lovely view of the strip. Tons of greenery around us. Their is an indoor and outdoor section (with heaters for the winter, and it's covered for summer shade).\n",
      "\n",
      "During happy hour Thursday's 4-8pm it's 5 stars. Right now probably 4 stars because the coffee tasted pretty trashy, and expensive for lacking in flavor brew ($3).\n",
      "  \n",
      "The food is surprisingly good. We had the pizza Blanca ($9.5): it had truffle oil, arugula, white sauce and mushrooms. Nice crust, good flavor. They have several decent craft brews available. We had a Samuel adams ($5-6)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was quite impressed with the cafe. I always assume food vendors and restaurants inside of museums or government buildings are more of a convenience than an actual attraction however the Divine Cafe has me waiting for next weekend to return. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love Veggie Benedict's so I gave theirs a try and to my surprise the ingredients were fresh and the presentation was impressive. The views of the valley are also worth trying the Cafe. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would have given them a 5 star review but the only reason I couldn't was because they cooked the spinach on the Veggie Benny instead of using fresh spinach leaves. This is more of a preference of mine vs an actual knock on the cafe. The rest of the menu was diverse and had many great, light summer type meals. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the menu was well thought out since most customers will be continuing their exploration of the park therefore need a light meal to avoid feeling sluggish. I enjoyde the cafe very much and can't wait to go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A snacking jewel in the Preserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent food and a surprisingly gorgeous view of the Strip is the main draw of the Divine Springs Cafe. I came here on Thursday for the Happy Hour special which is from 4pm to 8pm and offers bar food and a decent selection of beers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I went with the tater tots, that were free with a donated toy to \"Toys for Tots\", and the Chicken Nachos. I also sampled the house chips that we're placed on the table as soon as  sat down. This place is by no means a hot bed of foodie activity, but a more a refueling station after exploing the preserve.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food is on par with most bar bites, nothing was terrible, but it also wasn't mindblowing, it was just good. The Nachos are a huge portion and definitely shareable and the house chips were nice salty snack before we were inundated with salty carby treats. \n",
      "\n",
      "They only offer Happy Hour on Thursdays and the menu is pretty limited, but it's perfect food for socializing and catching up with the homies. I would recommend coming here during the day, this way you'll have a chance to snack on their full menu. \n",
      "\n",
      "Learn stuff and eat. It's the American way!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "New name and menu and improved food.  Checked our the restaurant at the Springs Preserve for the first time since the latest update.  I've eaten at the cafe 5-7 times over the years including when it was Wolfgang Puck and after as well.  I think this update is an improvement in both price and taste. We had 3 entrees and 3 kids meals for $44. My kids are 3,5,6 and the kids meals were a good amount of food for them asks included fresh fruit \\/ veggies. The kids mac n cheese is yummy and the snack tray was perfect for my 3year old. The lobster sandwich special was awesome with the tomato bisque soup especially for $10. The service was more attentive than in the past although I've never had an issue on previous visits they just seemed a little more helpful this time. In the past the foods quality was hit or miss and a little overpriced. As a member that meant we normally skipped the café.  With this update we will definitely stop more often on our visits.\n"

      "\n",
      "The fact that a museum\\/park restaurant has decent food is already a delightful surprise, but throw in a liquor license and happy hour and you've actually got something pretty unique. HH features live jazz and a limited menu of appetizers and seasonal cocktails, not to mention the phenomenal view.\n",

      "CHEESEBURGER SLIDERS: Nice chargrilled taste, thick patties, topped with lettuce, tomato, and burger sauce.\n",
      "ARTICHOKE AND CHICKEN NAAN: The highlight of our mini-meal! Served like a sandwich, think of a Panini made of naan, filled with cheese, artichoke, a bit of spinach, and strips of grilled chicken. This would make a good lunch option, generous portion.\n",
      "\n",

      "I almost hate to write to this review because sometimes you want to keep a great secret all to yourself. That's what I feel the Divine Café is - it's a place that not many people know about which is a shame because it's such a great place. It's a very open, casual place where the mix of customers seem to all be enjoying their meals. We go to the Divine Café every Saturday unless something comes up or I'm out of town and it seems like I always have the burger with cheddar cheese. These burgers are huge and come with either salad, fries, or their homemade chips. They are topped with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a really great pepper mayonnaise.  I've had great burgers here in Vegas, but for me all those other burgers don't compare to the burger here. This is the place with the best burgers. I always take the family so I've \"tasted\" other items from their menu and have to say that I have enjoyed everything I've tasted there. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Divine Café is located at the Springs Preserve so after eating we walk the trails or see the exhibits they have to offer. As members we get ten percent off our meal. The staff is always friendly - from the person taking our order to the person who brings the food to the table. It's a great place. The café has a great outdoor seating area that gives you a great view of the city. We love to sit outside and enjoy good company, good atmosphere, and good food.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I have out of town guests come to visit you know that before they leave Vegas they are going to the Divine Café.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food is delicious, waiting for the food took a while but it was during the superhero day so it was pretty busy. I wanna come here during Sunday brunch!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been meaning to check out this cafe (and the Springs Preserve) for awhile, and am happy to say it's definitely a place I'll be keeping on my \"go to\" list.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you don't need to be a member of Springs Preserve to go to the Divine Cafe, although I would highly recommend making a pleasant day\\/afternoon of it and seeing the Preserve, along with the Nevada State Museum which is also there on the grounds.   It's extremely interesting, educational and also great if you have out of town relatives or friends who are bored with the same old same old hotels, bars, Strip stuff.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Divine Cafe is wonderful to get away from  the noise, congestion and tourists - that's why so many locals have found it and enjoy going there for a bite.  It's located on the second floor near the Origen building.  You can take the elevator or stairs to get there.  It's a very open, clean and attractive space with indoor and outdoor patio seating.  If you sit on the patio\\/deck as I did, you can get a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding area, the Preserves, and off in the distance, the Strip. On a lovely day with cooler weather, it's certainly one of the more pleasant destinations around!\n",
      "\n",
      "You order your food from a nicely varied menu that serves up food every bit as good as any restaurant in town. As others have pointed out, this is not some cheapo snack bar with crappy burgers and hot dogs.  This is quality food.   When you place your order, they give you a cute little table holder with your order number.  You can sit anywhere you like, indoor or outside.    Yes, the prices are a bit on the high side, thus my four stars, however, it may be worth it to you for the location and quality.  I had the Angus burger ($9.50) and it was very good.  High quality beef, bacon strips, arugula leaves instead of the usual lettuce....I was very pleased! I ordered it \"well done\" and guess what?  It was cooked PERFECTLY!  None of that icky red beef that seems to be the \"in\" thing for burgers these days.  And the meat patty was still wonderfully juicy and had that top sirloin flavor that you'd expect from high quality beef. The bacon strips were also perfect - neither too thick nor too thin, crunchy yet not chewy as is often found on burgers today.  It  came with fries which were nicely seasoned, crisp, and flavorful.    \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the burger, I had the hazelnut beignets which came with TWO yummy dipping sauces - raspberry and caramel.  Price:  $6.00.  Again, a bit pricey but there was enough for two, so it was definitely splittable.  Total:  a bit over $16.00.  But hey, this is sort of a unique place, in the Preserves, with a view, so I guess you'd have to say you're paying for the ambiance.  The food is very good and is really  better than other places I've been, both on and off the Strip.  Bottom line, I'd for sure go back and would be happy to bring out of town visitors here for an enjoyable day of browsing the Spring Preserves and then topping it off with a lovely lunch\\/brunch on the patio looking out at the view. You can also order beer and wine, although I didn't check that out.  I can see how it would be really nice to sit with a drink for awhile there.   Servers and staff were friendly helpful and very professional.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Divine Cafe opens at 11am (weekdays), 10am on weekends (brunch),  and closes  at 3pm, so be sure to time your Preserves browsing to end  back at Divine Cafe around 1:00 or so, you don't want to feel rushed to eat and leave by 3pm.   Thanks Divine Cafe, for a very enjoyable meal!  Looking forward to doing brunch next time and having  the french toast! I'm sure it's fab!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A four star just for the view alone...if you sit in the outdoor area that is. I've been lucky in that each time I've eaten here, I get a primo seat on a primo day and you can look out over the Preserve and far beyond. Very nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the food - it's good too. Used to be a Wolfgang Puck branded place, menu is a little different now, in fact they offer a good daily special board. It's run by the Culinary Institute now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had their BBQ pork sandwich, served with homemade crinkle cut chips (very tasty). The BBQ sauce was very smokey flavored, thick and a good balance of sweet and savory. Well done Culinary Institute! \n",
      "They offered a roasted butternut squash soup which was nicely prepared\\/presented (in fact all their food is) and tasted good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a nice place to relax a bit in between or after checking out the Preserve.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went there for the Thursday happy hour. Had a  glass of the cabernet on happy hour. Tasted great...so I had two. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bacon and date flatbread was excellent and I'm not a big fan of dates. I would come back and order that though. I would give that five stars.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was not impressed with the sliders on the happy hour menu. Actually very very disappointing. The whoopie sauce was basically ketchup and the buns tasted dry like they had been sitting out for days. The meat was way overcooked and lacked any flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a bite of the lotsa mozza salad. It was good. It didn't look like a traditional salad. It was on a polenta cake that tasted like cornbread and had marinara and arugula on top. It was quite good. I would recommend trying it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also had the chicken Verde nachos. They were huge! Not very impressed with the taste though but nothing really that bad about them either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just whatever you do don't get the sliders or else you may never come back. Glad the other people I came with ordered better than I did and let me sample a little bit of everything on the happy hour menu. Had a nice time and the view on the patio was spectacular.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What do I love about this restaurant!? I adore being able to sit outside on the terrace and eat my lunch. I love the variety of food they offer and the specials. It is near my work so every now and then I come over and dine here. I really enjoy their fresh, creative salads, the flatbreads are tasty and just last week I tried the special being tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. The service is good and looking out over the Springs Preserve into the city is absolutely beautiful not to mention relaxing. I love that they have a happy hour on Thursdays where one can come have a drink and listen to some music before heading home. As we all know driving up the 95 kinda stinks at the old 5:00 hour. They also offer creative cooking classes which I have yet to try as I am not Giada but maybe I will get around to it someday. This is a great kick back spot and we need to support this place. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!\n"

      "There aren't many restaurants more \"under the radar\" than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve. It's out of the way for most tourists visiting the Strip or Downtown and it's a destination most locals don't think of when looking for a meal, unless you're also visiting the exhibits at Springs Preserve. With a kitchen led by Steve Piamchuntar (former chef and owner of Nosh & Swig) they're serving up some surprisingly good dishes for lunch and brunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chef Steve has brought his refined skills and whimsical and modern touch to this cafe. With their recently changed menu they're offering a diverse menu with plenty for adults and kids, alike. Standard American fare like caesar salads, burgers, and pizzas are available. While the burger ($9.50) was decent, non-typical dishes make this place shine compared to other cafes in town. Singapore chicken cups ($9.50) are lettuce wraps with balanced sweetness and savoriness. The pressed chicken milanese ($11) is a must. It eats like a sandwich but has flavors that are fitting for any larger meal. For brunch the pan dulce french toast ($8) was great. More like a creamy bread pudding with bread soaked through with custard, it's perfect for those wanting to satisfy their sweet tooth early in the day. And, to polish off a meal try the root beer float ($6). It's accompanied by an Oreo dusted churro that's as good as any you'll find in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "My meal was fully comped, but I did tip appropriately. They're typically only open for lunch or brunch, but are open Thursdays and have happy hour specials and live music.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The vegan burger is my favorite thing on the menu and I'm a meat eater. It's surprisingly good. No wait, I lied. The Monte Cristo sandwich is the best thing that has ever been on the menu. Unfortunately it is no longer being sold.\n",
      "Also, the Springs Cafe is astonishingly better than the Wolfgang Puck crapshack it has replaced. There's just no comparison.\n",
      "If you're going to the Springs Preserve you'd might as well eat there. The food is pretty good and you can't beat the convenience.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great lunch spot with a diverse selection, can't beat the views and the environment of the springs preserve itself. I want to come back and try their happy hour or brunch, too, when I have more time! The only downside is each time I've been in there's only been a few people in line to order at the counter, usually only one person taking the orders, and it's been very slow. The last time it took over 20 mins to get through the three of us in line, and that's half the time I have for my lunch. Other than that, the experience and food were great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had the spinach salad with the beef, for $12 they need to throw on more spinach and less red onions, overall the salad was good.  My husband enjoyed his fish tacos and my kids could have split a kids meal, the pbj and grilled cheese sandwiches were huge and the fruit bowl that comes with the kids meal is huge too .. all for $4 per kids meal (sandwich, fruit and milk).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A very nice cafe on the grounds of the Spring Preserve. The Hawaiian pizza was really good, but I think it's bigger than they advertise. Not really a problem, but keep that in mind that two people could easily share a small personal pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great view of Vegas from the restaurant and the balcony.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent food in a relaxing atmosphere. I had a bowl of the pork fajita soup and enjoyed the rich stock, black beans, tomatoes, chunks of pork, and tortilla strips. The ice tea is flavorful. They deliver the food to your table and check on you midway through eating. I will return whenever I can.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have to say, with the change away from Wolfgang Puck's name - it's a welcome change. I was getting tired of seeing the same things on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been here several times since the new change - and I have to admit, I like the new changes they have come up with. There are a few staples, but they also incorporate a lot of new dishes, and that has got my taste buds singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last time I came out here I had the Bento Box, my daughter the grill cheese, and the other couple I was with shared a burger meal. I loved the Bento Box - a little greasy for the egg roll, but everything else was just right!\n",
      "\n",
      "The specials are swapped out more frequently - and that is a good change to see! It's nice to see fresh ideas moving in, and get the future generations touch of good meals! You can definitely see the urge to please from the employees as you wait for your food. They show genuine concern for your happiness during your meal, and if things are delayed they are genuinely apologetic about it all! \n",

      "Might as well check out the rest of the preserves while you are there! (Or if you are there first, then might as well eat here!)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After a couple of hours touring the Springs Preserve I was feeling a bit hungry and thirsty.  I was also kind of hot as late May in Las Vegas is starting to warm up.  To complete my experience I thought I would give Divine Cafe a try.  It did not disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a burger because I was hungry.  I ordered an iced tea because I was thirsty.  I ordered a salad because I was hot.  It did not take long for my burger to come out.  And it came out perfect.  I asked for medium and that is exactly what I got.  It was still pink in the center and taste like quality fresh beef.  I had juice dripping down to my elbow so you know it wasn't dry.  The toppings were good too.  A nice thick slice of tomato, greens, super crisp bacon.  It was a fantastic burger.  The salad was pretty good too.  I like the greens they used.  And the cucumber slices were a nice touch.  I would have been upset about not having my choice of dressing but it was exactly what I would have ordered anyway.  A delicious vinaigrette.  The one complaint I had about the salad was the 8 inch long stripps of carrot that looked like orange noodles.  They were kind of hard to eat as they were too thin to be picked up by fork the way everything else was.  Other than that, no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was fortunate that the staff at the order window saw I had left my bag from the gift shop at the counter.  I had a couple of things in there I did not want to leave without.  Like my ball cap and sunglasses.  I was worried when I could not find my bag but then I noticed they had pushed it aside and were waiting for me to collect.  Goodonya, Divine Cafe.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay, so first of all, my ahi salad was very, very good. Also, cucumber water is always a treat. And, the view is spectacular; one of the best in the city. Now that's out of the way...can we talk price vs portion? My salad was delicious, but for a $10+ salad, I'd appreciate a larger helping. I'm not even asking for more Ahi; there was plenty of that; buy dump on the greens, I can take it. Also, and this was purely circumstantial, though I can imagine it happening often: people's children. Christ on a cracker, can you please control your little zoo animals? Letting your children run, play, roll around on the floor, and use adjoining empty tables as their own jungle gyms is not only rude to other patrons, it demonstrates a significant deficiency in parental ability. To the restaurant: please discourage this kind of obnoxious behavior. I absolutely love the Preserve, but hesitate to bring my friends with me to Divine Cafe, lest we get caught up in some variant Lord of the Flies scenario. Otherwise, thanks for the fresh lunch and the relaxing, refrigerated view on a sunny day.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We go to the preserves often we think it is a great under utilized resource for knowledge for our community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fabulous pace to take the kids and visitors in showing Vegas.  This is our first time eating at the Cafe.  We are happy we went, they have lots of fresh items.  Salads, veggies and whatnot, the salad my man ordered was amazing he loved it, fresh crispy iceberg wedge.  I got the Caesar, yummy.  We also got the CHARCUTERIE a nice basic variety of tasty Cheese and Meats but good.  We finished off with a TURKEY WRAP it was so good, I was so full but ate more then I wanted.  \n",
      "\n",

      "This past weekend, my bf and I did a quick trip to Champaign, because we just needed to get out of Chicago for a couple of days.  When we parked our car and walked down Green St., there were a whole bunch of NEW restaurants compared to when I went to college years ago.  One familiar restaurant was Zorba's.  Got two med. gyros, fries, and drinks to go.  When we sat outside on the quad, we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro.  So eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all!  Really good and the pita seemed fresh and light, not super greasy like the joints here in Chicago.  Don't think I'll go back to Champaign for a long time, but it's a great lunch\\/dinner option.\n",

      "Mmmm... gyro.  I know that Zorba's isn't authentic Greek food-- I go to Chicago for that, but for what it is, it's excellent.  The service is always very friendly and speedy, and they have a fairly large menu and is inexpensive.  They also have Killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection.  Zorba's is probably my favorite green street eatery.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came to Zorba's on the suggestion by a cousin who has, and I quote, \"never given a bad food recommendation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was another hit!  Chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At other Greek spots, I'm used to having a humongous foil wrapped hunk of a mess of gyro served to me that I inevitably finish... and end up feeling like a blob because I didn't want to waste food.  But Zorba's is here to help you with portion control!  I like how they offer their gyros in 4 different sizes.  Oh, and try the cucumber sauce.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You know you're in for a treat when it takes 9.8 seconds for the grease in your meal to seep through the bottom of the paper bag.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place was delicious!\n",
      "My roommate and I came here on default because the other place we were trying to go to was already closed!\n",
      "But good thing the gyros & fries here were delicious and made-to-order!  And the gyro meat tasted super fresh!  I loved how you can get extra cucumber sauce and the \"hot sauce\" obviously was mixed with the cucumber sauce...all delicious!\n",
      "The establishment has been open for awhile and I can see why college students would come here after partying!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "ok, so I went to Zorbas today. first time I've been there since the fire. I'll start 9ff buy saying the food tasted great as expected.\n",
      "that being said I noticed a few things that concerned me. \n",
      "1. no longer is there the choice of beef, chicken or lamb. the choices are chicken and a beef\\/lamb mix. \n",
      "2. the meat is no longer sliced to order but sliced ahead of time and kept in a steam table. it tastes better when sliced to order and heated on the griddle.\n",
      "3. the Baklava was really tough almost impossible to cut.\n",
      "remember, I DID say the food still tasted great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been here multiple times and it is truly the best place for food on Green Street. I have gone with the gyros both times and have not been disappointed. The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. On top of it, the atmosphere gives you a feel to what our culture at U of I is like. Pass up the chains and go to Zorba's. Take it from an ILLINI - you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Cool place for lunch on campus... It's right next door to Za's, where I've going a bit too often, so I'm glad I finally gave it a try. They're specialty is gyros sandwiches (on pita bread): pick your meat (lamb or chicken), size (small, medium, large), and sides (get the combo which comes with fries and a drink). I tried the chicken, and it was good, although I wish the meat had been a little more grilled (it wasn't crispy at all). Their fries are great! They also have a few other things on the menu (regular sandwiches etc), and they're open late most nights. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Loved the Greek salad and gyro plate. This is a staple in  campus town for good reason. The inside displays classic Illini newspaper clippings, and the staff is kind and welcoming. Check them out if you're in the mood for a gyro.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The gyros were pretty good, but their fries came with this amazing sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a delish combination of honey mustard but smelled and tasted like there was bacon in it.  I'm not sure what exactly it was but we couldn't stop dipping our fries in it - so good!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great gyros and fries. Often crowded, so plan on a wait for food and a table.  Go on Tuesdays for discount prices.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is fantastic. Everything from their gyros to hummus to fries are all on point. Live jazz is great (I forget which nights) and their special deal on Tuesdays makes this a great lunch spot on Green Street. This place definitely exceeds expectations in Chambana, and I hope it continues to thrive!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hands down the most underrated place on campus. Everything they offer is at least good, while their gyros are nothing short of amazing (for Chambana, at least). The jazz shows are a nice touch, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always friendly. One of my favorite places to spend a break, whether it's between classes or during work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five-star rating, but it deserves a strong four.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt and his gang do a great job. Love the chicken Gyros.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good food and I love all the dipping sauces.  Best gyro I've had on campus.  Not a huge variety of food, though.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "so greasy it burned the fuck down ! i am sure each gyro and basket of fries i ate there each knocked 6 months off of my lifespan. All I can say is I;m still alive so I obviously didn't eat there enough\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tender gyros meat at decent prices. Just stick with a gyros sandwich (the fries are mediocre). This place has been around since my parents were on UIUC's campus in the early-mid 70s and it's a great place to take them. I can't speak to the seating during peak hours because I usually would drop by here if there was a deal on Hooked midafternoon if I hadn't eaten lunch.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The classic chicken gyro is one of the simplest and best gyros I have ever eaten though the taste could have been more exotic. The Hooked deal of getting a meal in the cost of a gyro for take out is quite cheap and worth the price. Also I would recommend fish lovers to visit on Friday as they have some amazing deals and fish  dishes on friday.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "i used to eat the gyros here as a student and loved them...now that i'm all grown up i still love to eat here but i just eat the veggies on a pita with that yummy cucumber sauce and still love their fries.  i think what i love about this place more than the food is the fact that every single time i come here, i run into a friend, who is likely another uiuc alum, who happens to also have ended up living here, we strike up a conversation and realize the place feels even better when you're not procrastinating studying for an exam.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The joint that launched my love affair with the gyro. Their tzatziki sauce is still my favorite, and the chili is delicious.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "You like gyros? You like fresh fries? You like Green Street? Well, then you'll love Zorbas.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Zorbas was a staple during undergrad and it hasn't lost its taste in the years since I've left.  Regardless of where I move or visit, every gyro I have is compared to Zorbas - they're the gold standard in my mind.  The meat is always juicey and the fries always salty.  Perfect for a social lunch or a recovery meal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Word to the wise - load that sucker up with extra meat and tzatziki sauce (or \"cucumber sauce\") for maximum flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is where I spend 20 minutes every Tuesday night.  Good gyros, cucumber sauce, etc., and thanks to Groovy Tuesdays you can get a kickass feta (+hummus, if you like) veggie pita for a little over $2.  Service is fast and it's not usually too crowded.  Nice, tall tables too.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good good fast! Pricing was reasonable. I was a bit taken aback by my hummus and pita arriving as a sandwich instead of separate. The bread was great, the hummus was just average. I really liked my gyro though!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Awesome gyros. Especially when you're listening to Spyro Gyra. On iTunes.\n"

      "This is some incredibly tasty and greasy food. I walked around like a confused tourist for a moment while looking for the menu. I'm pretty indecisive so I would prefer a menu that wasn't taped to the counter where you order. Being able to peruse a bit would have been nice. Even so, I ordered a falafel with feta and jalapenos and it was fantastic. Even the fries were delicious and I'm just not a potato fan. The biggest pro - They have a tzatziki dispenser! Most places charge you for extra and considering condiments are the highlight of my meal, this was fantastic! I also thought the gyros were delicious although it is tough to mess that up I think. The price is great, you can eat here for just about $5.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great Greek food including awesome Gyros!! They also have live music here a lot which is a great escape from doing your homework!  This place gets busy as lunch because it's right by the quad!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gyros, tzatziki, fries, and friendly cooks and cashiers make this place a must-go.  My parents graduated from the U of I in 1981, and Zorba's was there back then!  Considering the relatively high turnover rate of Campustown restaurants, I think that's pretty impressive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A Champaign Institution, great gyros, with even better service.  Definitely a can't miss when you are on Illinois' campus.  Check their daily specials before you go in some of them are great.  The fact that you can order a small, medium. or large gyro and customize it however you want make it good for any size appetite.\n",

      "Going up to four stars and rising.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Have only been there once but was a big fan of the gyros. Had an large original gyro with fries and was a pretty good deal for $7.50. Very tasty\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yep, it lived up to the hype. Great gyro sandwiches with a cool local feel. The pita is soft and the gyro meat is some of the most tender I've found. Brilliantly seasoned too, the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart. I also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place has a nice, local college hotspot feel. Not wild and crazy, but more the kind of place students stop by on their way to and from class.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love the gyros here.\n",
      "I love their cucumber sauce even more :)\n",

      "\n",
      "Service is good and there is plenty of room to eat right in the restaurant.  The only \"problem\" is that you'll smell like gyro, onion, and grease when you leave.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I absolultely LOVE gyros so this is a no-brainer for me. I feel like this place is a staple of quick, delicious campus food. It's pretty much a total hole in the wall, but it's totally Illini, everything about the decor just screams it. Not to mention the gyros are bomb. Go if you haven't already!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "good ole z-bots as we liked to call this one back in the day.  yes, this place is an institution...been around since green and wright was just spaceport, garcias, and mcdonalds.  hasnt changed much cept that now i can drink the beer.  wonder if they will still accept my stamp card from way back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't believe I walked past this place for three years.  What is more sad is that many of those times were likely while I walked into Subway across the street on a Tuesday afternoon to drop $5 on a Veggie Delight.  Little did I know I could get a delicious, warm, and fresh vegetable hummus pita across the street for a little over a dollar.  At least I have many more Tuesdays ahead to take advantage!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Definitely some of the best falafel I've eaten. This is a great place to go for lunch or a casual, light dinner.  The employees are friendly, the location is convenient, and the prices are reasonable.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After my horrendous experience with Niro's I was optimistic that Zorba's might have a better gyro.\n",
      "\n",
      "The store is right on Green street and impossible to miss walking by. Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I did not like was the portion\\/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be back to try more!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gyros are soooo tasty, I keep coming back for more. Price is okay and service is fast. Only complaint would be portion size for their salads...their small was much smaller than in most places, but it was yummy. Seriously try their gyros.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decent gyros at a decent price -- a large gyro combo costs around $7, and less if you manage to get a deal on the Hooked app. The meat is a tad dry, but the sauces somewhat make up for it. 3.5 stars\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What can you say about a campus institution like Zorba's? If you crave great gyros sandwiches and fries served fast, this is the place to visit. Super Niro Gyros serves good food but Zorba's has them beat for a quality product. Not a place to come for ambience, unless you like hanging out with self-absorbed Millennials with hands permanently attached to their iPhones. The tzatziki sauce is worth the price of admission though. Highly recommended.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I took the recommendations of many and did make a reservation for a Saturday night a few days in advance, which was wise because we got the last table available. The space might be tiny, and the chairs might wobble a little bit, but the latin music will keep your body swaying. You will definitely find an authentic Mexican feel compared to any of the other restaurants in the city, but on to the food!\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the grilled corn with lime and quesco fresca. It is permeated with lime, and it tastes as if it has been swimming in a vast sea of lime. It is quite flavourful and delicious. Just wish it came with more cobs!\n",
      "\n",
      "For our mains, we shared a plate of the ancho braised short rib tacos in the golden crispy tortillas, and a plate of tacos al pastor. The better of the two was definitely the ancho braised short rib. The crispy taco sets them apart from some of the other taco joints in the city, and the flavour and texture was quite superior to the tacos al pastor. The only downside is they can be a little messy. The tacos al pastor was pretty light on the pineapple, and could have used a little sauce, and even seemed smaller than the short rib. Plus they came in a soft tortilla shell which wasn't as special. I don't think I'd order them again. On the other hand, the short rib tacos were good enough that we ordered another round.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on to dessert. The tres leches cake was amazing and one of the best desserts I've ever had. At a reasonable 7 dollars, and big enough for sharing. This is a dessert you don't want to pass on. It isn't overall sweet, and it doesn't taste one note. I found the taste and texture of the dessert transformed in my mouth and finished differently on both accounts. 5 stars for this dessert, and would be the main reason I would go back. It will leave you feeling good about your choice of passing on a McFlurry from McDonald's on the way home, and if that is not a win, I don't know what is.\n"

      "\n",
      "When we showed up the place was pretty full, both inside and on the patio. We asked one waiter what the wait was for a table inside (as it was pretty chilly out) he said 30-45 minutes, I was so sad! Luckily another waiter spotted us and told us there was a table of 2 that had just cleared up - so we eagerly took a seat.\n",

It is served in a chilled, salt-rimmed glass) - it wasn't on the Menu - so if you haven't tried it yet - I definitely recommend it!

      "\n",
      "The server punched in the Ceviche but the kitchen never saw it, so they forgot about the Ceviche, which had me a bit bummed at first, but then when I was about finished my third taco, I  realized it was probably a blessing in disguise... I was absolutely full! The Tacos were great, they Brisket tacos, had pico de gallo, frejoles and guac, they were very rich in flavours, very tasty; and the fish tacos were larger and more filling than I expected, fried goodness - squeeze that whole lime wedge on top and you have perfection!!\n",

      "I ordered a margarita made with Tromba tequila. Very tasty. It was the perfect balance of sweet, sour and tequila. And you could actually taste the tequila. \n",
      "\n",
      "We shared the guac and chips. Their chips are so good! Fresh and crunchy like they should be. For my main I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (Baja style). Also excellent. If you're getting an appetizer to share I would recommend getting these tacos without the beans and rice. They were very filling on their own. They had this light but creamy coleslaw mix on top of the battered fish which was a nice contrast to the deep-fried-ness of the fish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Including ours, all the meals I saw served around us looked very fresh and well presented. The food has definitely lived up to the hype, in presentation and taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and made good recommendations. The only downside to the evening was the time it took for our appetizer and food to be served: longer than normal. I also wish their sipping tequila wasn't $14 minimum an ounce, I passed on it this time. It's expensive because it's excellent quality, so I understand. The cheaper tequilas were ones you shoot and they had a huge selection. I will have to explore their tequila menu more next time I'm here!\n",

      "This place is amazing! The menu has many options to chose from, including taco trios, dinner plates and massive burritos with very generous portions. The shredded steak is amazing! The ceviche not so much. I love the vibe of this place and it's a nice break from the noisy and overly crowded taco restaurants in the downtown core. It has become my new favorite restaurant for tacos\\/burritos.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went today with a friend for lunch. great service, split the grilled fish tacos (TACOS DE PESCADO (BAJA-STYLE) and slow roasted pork tacos (TACOS DE CARNITAS). The chicharones on the carnitas were such a great textural lift. Guac was fine, chips with it were better. Will return for some ceviche. Only thing is we didn't eat fast enough and the soft tortillas were tearing. Great atmosphere- very cozy\\/friendly.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "LOVE this place. Do not love, however, the fact that weekend reservations now have to be made weeks in advance. This means Playa Cabana needs to expand its small space and fast.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here you will find amazing guacamole prepared to your spice tolerance and accompanied by homemade tortilla chips, grilled corn, tacos and other favourites served up with the best Margaritas in the city.  The Margaritas deserve a second sentence to express just how good they are with many variations in flavour and tequila.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just have a couple qualms: 1) the prices would be a little lower in cities with more Mexican options and 2) please expand!\n",

      "This cute beach shack tucked away in a quaint Dupont\\/ Davenport neighbourhood peaked my curiosity.  I have driven by it a few times and it always looked busy so it was definitely on my hit list to try.  It was a Saturday night on one of our snow falls in Toronto.  It was awful outdoor weather for both driving and walking as people forget how to drive in snow and the flakes are blowing everywhere so it's hard to look up.  I finally stumble into the intimacy of Playa Cabana only to find a very busy and bustling restaurant with all tables full, a line up of folks crowding in the small entranceway and a waiting list that only has openings in about an hour and a half. \n",
      "We luckily get seated only after waiting 15 minutes!\n",
      "We start with the house made guacamole which is delicious and freshly prepared.  It is reminiscent of my favourite guac in the city from Chimichangas (now closed) and the owner may know a thing or two as Dave was the former co-owner there. \n",
      "I also want to try the cerviche which is pickerel.  It comes packed with a good kick and is a big appetizer meant for sharing!\n",
      "The vegetarian burrito and it was a humungous portion but so delicious, my friend was able to polish it without issue.  I ordered the baja fish tacos which came grilled \n",
      "They are one of the best fish tacos I've had and I ate at another trendy mexican resto earlier that week so it's a bold statement!  For more heat - we were given 2 house made hot sauces:  the habanero salsa- WOAH - this gives you a big kick of heat but it creeps up on you.   The other one was the roasted chile arboles salsa - which gives you some good heat and is just right for me.\n",
      "Hasta luego!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had the Octopus Taco (Tacos de Pulpo)\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was amazing and they were very accommodating with drinks (asked for a cocktail to be made without sugar and they had no problem). They give an appetizer platter for the table for free, which nearly filled us up as is. The tacos were amazing and the staff friendly and helpful. I only took away a star as it was so loud in there it's hard to hear your table and have to talk on the top of your voice. I'll definitely recommend and will be back, especially if I don't mind a bit of a headache that night lol\n",

      "\n",
      "A bit slow on the service but the ambience is quite fun. It's busy at lunch and I'm sue it's busier at dinner. I can only imagine how hard it would be to find a seat at that hour.\n",

      "\n",
      "The place is small and quaint, but is very popular in the evening creating a very tight space. However I could look past that because the food is amaaaaazing! My boyfriend and I ordered drinks, snapper ceviche, chorizo tacos & short rib tacos and finished off with churros. It was truly a love at first bite! At first I was worried about portions, as everything look small on yelp, however food was soo filling! The staff was warm and welcoming however they were not as attentive as they should've been. They were quick to seat us & say hello but didn't take initiative to check on their tables, instead most servers were huddled around the bar just socializing. This caused quite a waiting game when I was in need for water or when we wanted to order our mains & dessert. I'd only hope the service is better the next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm not going to lie - have never been the biggest fan of Mexican food. That being said, had a very good experience here. I think what stands out the most is really the atmosphere of the place - very European feel. A real pleasure to go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was 7\\/10. Had the beef flutes, civiche, guacamole, salsa, and fish tacos. Overall, very well prepared, but the tastes weren't 100% to my liking, again, possibly biased haha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, the group was very happy with the meal, and the Sangria was pretty good (ask for less ice). Parking isn't too hard to find by the way, but you should expect to look on the streets. I'd say it's a great date place as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "In between our office and hotel, this was the perfect choice for us. We were seated in the back alcove . They sell beers by the bucket so we said why not? Our server was nice and didn't rush us or anything. I got the carnitas tacos and they were good. Pretty authentic food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really enjoyed the dinner. Guacamole was excellent. Split some fish and chicken tacos and really liked both. The only knock is that there was no beer on tap; bottle selection was good though.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been to many different playa cabana locations and I must say that they have great tacos! I have had some times where the service is slow, however, the food is always great and satisfying\n",

      "I'm a native Californian, so when deciding to take my fiancee, a Toronto resident, for Mexican food, I thought that I would have to aggressively contain my expectations given that most of my Canadian friends complain about the dearth of good Mexican food here. I was surprised by how delicious the food was but I was dismayed by some aspects of the service. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, despite the fact that the restaurant was not remotely busy, we were not approached by a server for at least ten minutes after being seated. In fact, the hostess had to ask another server to see us because our intended one just kind of fu*ked off and attended to maintaining his bizarre Caucasian-Last-Samurai-topknot-bro-on-a-spiritual-granola-journey haircut.  Thanks, guy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our replacement server, Raul, kept the party going and did the damn thing and did so promptly and politely. Commendations to Raul. The food was to our liking, although it does kind of feel like you're paying for the restaurant's comforts when you can get the same caliber food at a truck in Los Angeles for a fraction of the cost. Despite the omitted fifth star, I would urge folks in Toronto desperate for a quality Mexican food experience to try this place out. DEFINITELY make reservations first. There is no harm in doing so and it struck me as the sort of place that is frequently busy, as it was tonight.\n"

Their portions are generous and it feels and tastes like authentic mexican food.  Packed full of flavour.  The meat pork in the playa burrito was divine and my tacos were juicy yet crispy from the shells.  I will go back to try the other items on the menu.\n",

      "\n",
      "The food was awesome! Lots of flavour. I don't think there was anything we didn't like. Some of the favorites amongst the group included the shrimp bucket, lobster taco, both types of fish taco, and braised short-rib taco. They were all very tasty and served with a healthy portion of meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one mishap during the meal though...one of the sangrias came with a loooooooong strand of hair :S (It was stuck on the ice cube...) They were very apologetic and a fresh one was made right away. \n",

      "Going to this place has become a ritual for my boyfriend and I. We go every year when the patio opens. We don't go more often only because we eat way too much every time. I'd recommend getting more appetizers than meals. My fav combo is the guac, the corns and the shrimp (sorry I don't recall the Spanish words). I personally didn't love the Chorizo sausage. It was too spicy and saucy for me. \n",

      "So you and your friend have a hankering for Mexican food  while downtown....I wanted to see if this place was about the food or about the flash. Located at 111 Davenport Rd, ( note: they have a second location in the junction) it is a little hidden from the main strip of the Avenue Rd \\/ Yorkville restaurants. It felt to me more of a locals hangout as the customers and staff seemed familiar with each other. \n",
      "The restaurant is small and cozy with a very nice patio. Decor was nice and tasteful unlike some other Mexican places that want to scream at you that they are Mexican (Also, I'm glad they didn't do that whole \"day of the dead\" theme that a lot of places are doing these days) anyway, now to the food. \n",
      "They have a good menu that highlights the usual fare. Tacos, enchiladas, as well as main plates. The liquor menu is what you would expect in a Mexican restaurant with lots of tequila choices and Mexican beer. ( $20 for a 5 bucket of beer) I started with a Dave's margarita on he rocks( they don't serve the slushy kind) and the usual guacamole dip and the daily ceviche both served in a stone bowl and made fresh. Both were excellent and well made. I opted for the Carne Asada platter with beans and rice and tortillas. The presentation was nice and the portions were good. Now I have had this dish at other places before (in Mexico) and I prefer my meat cooked and served without sauce on it. The flank steak was good but it was cover in the sweet sauce that overpowered the flavour of the meat. The sauce was good and maybe it should be used as a side but not smothering the meat. Everything else was cooked perfectly and very tasteful.  Overall this place is good and well deserving of a try. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the sauce over the meat thing ....mmmm meat....\n",

We almost walked right past it, it was so well blended in with its surroundings.

      "- HOT SAUCE GAME IS ON POINT. There were 2 different hot sauces at our table and 2 different jars of chilli. For those who like spice, you will be in heaven! \n",
      "- The salsa appetizer with daily made tortillas was an excellent appetizer to share - although I usually prefer my salsa ingredients diced rather than blended, it was still very good.\n",
      "- We had originally ordered the ceviche but the server forgot to put in our order and we only realized once our mains were served with no sign of the ceviche - thought it would be odd to eat ceviche with our burritos so asked for salsa and tortillas instead. The salsa and tortillas was then comped for us, so we were satisfied \n",
      "- I ordered the playa burrito with ancho-braised steak - the portion was massive, could not finish it and brought some home with me. While it was delicious, it was served to me lukewarm... I hate when my food is lukewarm... I just didn't want to send it back when we already dealt with the appetizer issue. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place deserves its great food reviews. Their shortrib crispy tacos are about the most flavourful thing I've had in any Mexican restaurant in Toronto (including all those places open in the past couple of years where people like to line up for tacos) - assuming you like the idea of moist, saucy meat, freshly deep-fried shell, oozy cheese and creamy cool crema and guac on the side. I'm not an expert on \"authenticity\", but it's definitely delicious and not watered down for gringos.  They always have a daily ceviche and the fish tacos are great too. It tends to get really busy and may not be a good place to bring squirmy kids, but it's not hard to get a seat for two at off-peak hours. Their nacho chips are also freshly deep fried and crispily addictive.\n",

      "Playa Cabana definitely lived up to the hype. Went with a large group which presented the opportunity to do a tasting menu of a variety of different tacos and some apps as share plates. Listing everything would be an endeavour but the stand outs were definitely the fresh, flakey fish tacos, savoury rib steak tacos, and flavourful octopus tacos. The tostadas were impressive and the in-house hot sauces were all phenomenal. Definitely made a lasting impression, not to mention a great tequila selection and cocktail list.\n",

      "\n",
      "For the main, I had the Tacos De Pescado, which is the fish tacos. The tacos were on the sour-side of the taste palette, especially with the coleslaw in it. I would recommend not putting any more lime on it. The fish was very fresh.\n",

I prefer my dishes spicy so I asked for their spicy salsa and our server got me two kinds of spicy salsa. I absolutely loved them both! So folks ask for the spicy salsa. The churros were great as well: doughy, cinnamony,creamy!\n",

The guaca fresca comes in mild, medium, and hot. We asked for mild and they gave us two types of hot sauce on the side. I enjoyed both of them, but the habanero one (on the left) was really quite spicy, even for me. The other one- a roasted chile arboles salsa- was just perfect!\n",

This was definitely a heavier taco, and the flavours were also a lot bolder. The short rib-brisket combination was extremely juicy, resulting in an incredibly messy eating process (not that I'm complaining).

I'm not a big fan of  burritos in general, but I've read so many great reviews about the ones here that I was sorely tempted to try one. First of all, I thought the presentation was so pretty with the two contrasting sauces. Secondly, the portion was huge- our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomach! I was intimidated by the sheer massiveness of all the that pork, rice and beans- it was almost like a brick. In the end, Mel and I struggled to finish the whole burrito, and neither of us liked the green tomatillo sauce that much. To be fair, this was probably a very good burrito, but it was just not for me\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it was a birthday celebration, we obviously had to have dessert! First up, an order churros ($6). Unfortunately, I didn't love this version, as the dough was a little too dense and   the flavours were lacking a punch because they ran out of the cajeta dipping sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second dessert was a traditional Mexican flan ($7), and while it didn't look very pretty, the flavours certainly made up its looks. The flan was velvety smooth and rich, and even the side of whipped cream was delectable!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed dinner at Playa Cabana. The drinks were excellent, and I'd come back just for the guaca fresca! Though next time, I'd probably stay away from the burrito.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I came because of the yelp reviews. But now I'm going to keep coming because the food proved itself. It's soooo good. It's a little bit pricier than some of the other places in Kensington Market but they offer some really good stuff here. One of my personal favorite is the Playa burrito. It's so filling you can probably split it with someone. They also have a really big patio at the back so don't be fooled by how tiny the storefront looks. Service was really slow but good made up for it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was great and fresh. So full of wonderful flavors! The server was friendly. The atmosphere is lively and fun. The prices are high but the taste is worth the cost.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They do a great mexican! Vodka cesar's with Tromba is where it's at - also the spicy guac... Minus points for it always being packed - but i guess that's because it's small...\n"

      "Playa Cabana is a great spot for dinner and drinks.  Here are a few highlights from my experience...\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Like others who have mentioned this, I did feel rushed to order, then to order more, then to leave. This was slightly annoying, but we were having a good time anyway, and didn't really think much of it until after we left.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The tacos are a bit small, but they are fresh and delicious. I would order the chicken tacos again. (Be warned! Some of the table sauces are quite spicy!)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If you like guacamole, you will love their chips and guacamole. The chips, which can be a tinge greasy, are tasty and made in house.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The service, aside from being a bit rushed, was good. The recommendations for food and drinks were perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The vibe is loud and fun. I noticed that there was quite a diverse crowd here, which is nice as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. They have indoor and outdoor seating. To be mere steps from the corner of Davenport and Dupont, the outdoor patio seems quite removed from city traffic and noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great spot. There probably aren't many places in Toronto that can match Playa Cabana for Mexican food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Positively delicious food. But unfortunately, service is on and off (and when it's off, it's positively terrible). On the other hand, if you're served by the right person, you're in good hands. \n",
      "\n",
      "We visited for dinner on a weekday evening and we were seated dismissively by a server who waved us towards the direction of an empty table. Then we sat there and waited. And waited. And waited. For someone to give us a pair of menus. The place wasn't busy at all; servers were just sitting around involved in their own conversations. We tried to wave someone down several times to get a hold of menus, but no cigar. Because, obviously, we came to your restaurant just to sit, twiddle our thumbs, and stare at people eating (not). A good 20 minutes went by before a server came by and asked us what we wanted to order... unfortunately, without a menu we had no idea what to order. She seemed embarrassed that no one had given us menus or had greeted us yet, and brought us menus from the front. From that point forward, service was perfectly fine, as our server attempted to make up for the cold beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the guacamole and chips appetizer, the tacos de carnitas, braised short rib brisket  tacos, and a playa burrito. Absolutely delicious. My highlight was definitely the guacamole and chips combo - the chips were homemade, crunchy, and didn't taste like the usual run-of-the-mill corn chips you can get just anywhere. So delicious and had a very interesting texture - they definitely tasted and felt homemade. The burrito was quite large and a bit hard to eat, but the meat in both the burrito and the tacos were very tender and perfectly cooked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance is super dim and romantic - this is a great spot for a date or even dinner with friends. Very casual, relaxing atmosphere. For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $58.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I eat burritos like they're candy.\n",
      "So to have a burrito placed in front of me that was so exquisitely sculpted, dressed, topped and stuffed - it would have felt like a crime to inhale it. I savoured every bite of the Carne Molida Picadillo burrito. Even the margarita I had was fresh and delicious. And looking around the table, it doesn't seem like you can go wrong with whatever you order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere, music, and servers all feel VERY authentically Mexican - and their amazing homemade salsa took me right back to every vacation I've ever taken down there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love this place. The tacos are sooo good. Fresh ingredients; very authentic-tasting. Burritos are huge. Prices are reasonable for the portions & food quality! Guacamole + homemade chips are also delicious. The place can get a bit crammed, but a cool vibe overall. Would definitely recommend! Also, excellent service!!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Place is a small neighborhood gem. Food is all handmade, fresh and delicious. Place hold 50 inside, with an additional patio in nice weather. Service is attentive unless they are packed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worth visiting if you're nearby, but it's not a destination by itself.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The tacos and burritos were really quite good; definitely recommended for those who enjoy authenticish mexican food and a relaxed setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went for lunch and contrary to the cries about definitely needing a reso, wasn't a big deal for a table of two.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Was there yesterday for dinner with a friend. Loved the fresh salsa with cilantro & a basket of corn chips. I had a grilled fish taco & my friend had a crispy taco with chicken loaded with fresh salsa & guacamole washed it down with a glass of wine each.  \n",

      "Summary: Overall I really enjoyed my lunch at Playa Cabana. The restaurant itself is quite small so make sure to go early or make reservation. Seats are quite close together so it's not the most comfortable but you gotta give a little when it's for awesome food!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent Mexican, and probably very authentic (but what do I know?).\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was surprisingly busy on a Monday night, but we managed to snag a table for four without issue. The seating is TIGHT though; expect to be rammed against the seat behind you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chips and guac are excellent, though I didn't care for the wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the tacos al pastor were good, I think they were trumped by my partner's tacos de chori-queso. I mean, sausage and cheese? Yes please.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the burritos knock the tacos out of the park. In terms of value there's no comparison (burrito the size of my fat head), but the sauces they layer on top are phenomenal. I started diverting chips meant for the guacamole into the remnants of my dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordering to go is a hassle-free process, and they were prompt and punctual with the food. Given how tight the resto is take-out will be a viable option for us, despite the warm vibe of the place.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Big portion sizes at a not-so-bad price! Their in-house made chips and salsa are delicious. I'm not the most well-versed in all things Mexican, but this place comes off quite authentic - from when you first step over the threshold of what used to be a house to this small, intimate restaurant with Mexican music playing. They even had the heat turned up because my glasses fogged up as soon as I came in from the brisk March air. I'd definitely come back or at least check out their other location at DuPont and Avenue which is closer to the Yonge subway line.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is always busy but take reservations - yay!  There is a cute alcove in the back where we sat and began our journey at the Playa Cabana.  \n",
      "\n",
      "From the group, we got a bunch of share plates.  \n",
      "\n",
      "GUACAMOLE & SALSA - the guac was very fresh and came in those heavy stone bowls.  The Salsa was definitely the winner, it was very flavourful and the right amount of spice.  Very well done.\n",
      "\n",
      "FISH CEVICHE - this was a pleasant surprise!  It was tangy and citrusy and it cooked the fish just right with the blend of fresh herbs and lime.  \n",
      "\n",
      "CHORIZO CONQUISTADORES - couldn't even pronounce it, the server was very helpful!  It was all right, the was thin strips of meat in a slab of red sauce, wasn't a huge table fav.\n",
      "\n",
      "CUBETA DE CAMARON - this was definitely a winner, it was very delicious!  The shrimp were large and juicy!  The shrimp was tossed in a cajun butter sauce and when you sprinkle the lime on it, it is perfection!  Everyone at the table was pleased and the portion was plentiful!\n",
      "\n",
      "BEEF ENCHILADAS SUIZAS - this was a very large portion which would have been ideal for 2 if you were to share appies.  It was great, it was beef-off-the-bone tender, and the flavours were delicious.  It came with rice, guac and a choice of black or pinto beans.  A great choice!\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was great, very fast, attentive and took the time to explain everything and check on us to make sure we had everything.  The drink were another winner.  The MARGARITAS are famous there and they come in a pitcher!!!  We got the house Margarita (the first one on the drink menu) and it was so tangy and not too sweet, we shared it amongst 4 ladies and we got pretty tipsy after a few pitchers, at $29 you can definitely have a great time and get affordable drinks.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The bill after splitting everything was about $50 per person which was mucho affordable.  Must go, it was a great experience.\n"

      "BEWARE!!! You will need to get reservations at least a week in advance cause this place is sooooo popular and tiny as well. One of the best fish tacos I've had in toronto and certainly authentic mexican food. The mexican corn was $9 and was not worth it at all but it was dammmmm good. This place can become quite pricy when things add up. We got 2 tacos, corn and beer which all came up to about $65 bucks. Its a great place none the less but I probably wont be coming back here for a while\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Love this place! It is tiny, so definitely make a reservation. But, the atmosphere and food is great!\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been here a couple of times, and our favourite dish is the burrito. This thing is HUGE, but I actually managed to eat all of it. It is stuffed to the brim with deliciousness, and then topped with different sauces. I couldn't tell you what the sauces are, but it's magic. The homemade chips are salty, crunchy and fresh, and make an awesome pair to the homemade guacamole. \n",
      "\n",
      "On our first visit, I had the ancho braised short rib brisket crispy tacos, and I wasn't a fan at all. The filling was really heavy, with no citrus or acidic flavour to contrast. The tacos were also soggy, and I couldn't eat them with my hands. We will definitely be returning for the burritos!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Without a doubt, this is the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto.\n",
      "It reminds me a lot of Grand Electric in many ways, but I rate it higher than Grand Electric because the menu is authentic, larger, they takes reservations, and the place has a level of raw authenticity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food will blow your mind. It's simple and real mexican flavours, taco's made from scratch, kitschy and funny menu items like the bucket of shrimp, beautifully real ceviche, and even oysters. And well on the reasonably cheap side of the spectrum. \n",
      "\n",
      "The space is intimate and cute. It's tucked away at Dupont and Davenport, and is a neat little place to get away from the craziness of the Annex but still experience it's charm. \n",

      "The food was very flavorful- im not an expert on Mexican cuisine however, the combinations seemed to work every well and everything I ate that night was delicious! \n",
      "\n",
      "Take the time to make reservations and come visit ..... it's fantastic!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The homemade tortilla chips are really fresh and crispy. It's really difficult to hold back from consuming baskets of them. But you MUST leave room for tacos!    \n",
      "\n",
      "Shrimp bucket is another worthy app. Shrimps are tossed in shell in some arbol-garlic butter.They are juicy and buttery with a little kick of heat. They are a little challenging to peel and I found that a lot of the flavour was actually in the shell. The actual meat was not as flavourful as the shell. \n",
      "\n",
      "The braised shortrib brisket tacos are an ABSOLUTE MUST! The brisket was soooo tender and juicy with a little hint of sweet. \n",
      " \n",
      "The chorizo burrito didn't quite live up the expectations that the braised beef tacos set. It didn't pack the same level of flavour.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Visited Playa Cabana for the first time this week with a group of 6. They seated us right away (made a reservation the day before and they were able to accommodate us). \n",
      "\n",
      "The server was great - so attentive, not pushy. Food came out hot and was delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the ceviche, nachos and sausage appetizer to start. The ceviche was to die for!\n",
      "\n",
      "For a main I had the fish burrito which was massive but delicious. My friends ordered fish tacos, short rib tacos, and chicken burritos, and everyone enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had made a mistake about one of our orders, and when I mentioned it, the server was so apologetic, and insisted on making me a new one. I said it wasn't a problem, I was full from appys anyways, and she insisted on taking it off the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that, but they came out with free gelato for the table AND tequila shots for the entire restaurant!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason this is a 4 and not a 5 star is the place was crowded and we sat at an awkward high-top table where people kept bumping in to us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, great time, would definitely recommend!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Fun little place around Dupont and Davenport.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had Guaca & Ceviche as apps. Both very good. Guaca had a great little spicy kick to it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then had pescada tacos+ the tacos al pastor. The tacos were bigger or at least fuller than expected, but the quality was still there so good bang for the buck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the Mexican restaurants I've been to this is one of the best. The place is small so reserve! It's cramped but a fun cramped, like you're all part of the same big party visiting your new Mexican in-laws at a big pre wedding dinner! Except there we no Mexican nationals there to my knowledge, but you can imagine.\n",

      "Overall a worth the visit.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We made a reservation at Playa Cabana a few days prior for 3PM on a Saturday afternoon. When we arrived at 2:30PM a little early for our reservation the place was packed. They were able to seat us early and were very accommodating. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is small and tight with a casual & fun atmosphere. It was loud but not so loud you couldn't hear each other. \n",

      "If you are planning to go, make a reservation, you will be happy you did.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great place! Good authentic Mexican food and nice atmosphere (though a little cramped). Had the choriqueso tacos, the meat was well seasoned and cooked right, the cheese was queso Oaxaca, you can't usually find that here and when you do it's often not good but not in this case. Service was prompt, it's a small place but they had plenty of people on staff. Would definitely dine here again. \n",

      "\n",
      "The food took ages to arrive, so for some this may be an issue, but we were quite happy with our chips with (amazing) salsa and pitchers of margaritas!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the churros for dessert and found them to be a bit heavy\\/ overdone.  \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really great service and overall experience. For how exciting and innovative the dishes sounded - some of them fell a bit flat with regards to flavors. However, the cocktails were wonderful and we got our meals in great time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend you do not get seated in the back of the restaurant - it is a bit too close to the hot kitchen and much darker than other areas of the restaurant.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is probably one of my favourite Mexican restaurants in Toronto right now! I'm not Mexican so I can't vouch for authenticity, but the flavours were spot on! \n",
      "My friend and I shared the shrimp bucket for appetizers:\n",
      "Simply delicious butter and spice marinade! The only difficulty I found was in getting the shell off the shrimp meat, which was a disappointment because the shell taken on most of the flavour!\n",
      "\n",
      "For our main course we opted for the beef short rib tacos:\n",
      "These were amazing! The taco shell (I think they used paratha instead of a traditional corn shell?) was crispy while the beef inside was the best I've had! It comes with various toppings and a decent portion of guacamole which goes perfectly! \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't remember his name, but our server was amazing. Although it got busy super fast, my glass of water was never empty! \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely make a reservation beforehand as it is a small place, but soo worth it. (Especially if you're looking for spicy food - they had the best chillies)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great little restaurant! We almost missed it when we parked. My boyfriend and I showed up on a Saturday night without reservations, and luckily they had a table available immediately. I would recommend making reservations, as the dining area is small and always busy. \n",
      "\n",
      "What it lacks in size, it makes up for in quality of food. Toronto isn't known for their Mexican food, but this place breaks the mould. We ordered the guac and chips to start, baja fish tacos and steak burrito as mains, and the homemade lemonade to drink. The food was fresh and flavorful. The lemonade was on the sweet side, but good. We left full and happy and will be returning.\n"

      "Our friends suggested this place to us when we went to visit them in Toronto as this is their go-to spot for great Mexican food and I can definitely see why ! The food was so fresh and flavourful and the portions were very filling and for a great price ! we shared the spicy shrimp bucket to start , the shrimp were nice and big and very fresh but if you're not a fan of spicy this may not be the choice for you. butttttt if you like spicy food like I do then these are a great choice - muy caliente ! We also had the octopus taco which I was very excited about since I love octopus but I never really had it in taco form - it was delicious (also spicy) the octopus was grilled to perfection and the fresh corn and fresh toppings made it even better. As the main course my boyfriend and I shared the chorizo burrito which came topped with a fried egg, salsa Roja, salsa verde and cotija cheese. The burrito is pretty big and pretty freaking delicious ! (Though not really spicy but very flavourful). For dessert we shared the tres leches cake which was so light and not overly sweet. Also worth mentioning is the fact that they offer indoor and outdoor seating and do serve a variety of beers and cocktails. My only complaint is that the indoor seating is a little bit tight so there's not much room but as soon as the awesome food came I forgot all about that ! All in all I really enjoyed playa cabana and think it's a great spot to go with some friends or a date for some great Mexican food !\n",

      "A friend and I were looking for a nice lunch spot after visiting castle Casaloma. We came across this small but cozy authentic Mexican place. They served us house made chips with guacamole as appetizers. The guacamole is served in a molcajete (stone bowl). I thought that was pretty cool!!\n",
      "For our mains we got fish tacos (Tacos de Pescado) and beef short rib tacos (Ancho Braised Short rib crispy Tacos). They were amazing!!\n",
      "I would definitely go back to this place on a daily base if I lived in Tdot. Thank you Playa Cabana!! I will be back.\n",

      "Nice restaurant in an offbeat location on Dupont. Easy to get to if you get off at St George subway and just walk straight up Bedford for 5 minutes to Dupont. Its basically right there. Small little place which gets larger with the amazing patio on the outside. We started out on the patio but unfortunately the rain took us inside to a very hip locale with bar seating in the middle of the restaurant. Not sure what it was but there was lots of groups of young women at the restaurant this night.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was quick and had waters to our table super quick. Unfortunately two of the three waters had remnents of left over food items in them. Getting past this the night only got better. The food was fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the Guacamole\\/chips. Loved the baked tortillia chips. The Guac was tasty also.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a burrito which was beyond huge. Filled with chicken, rice, black beans and all sorts of other goodness was super tasty and super rich. Desert? After you just served that oversized piece of goodness? Don't think so. Overall a super spot and fairly reasonablly priced food. Drinks were slighly pricey but where aren't they these days.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Order the Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos!!! Amazingly delicious. Slap- your- mama -in- the- face good! The Ceviche is a great app, their guac is really authentic and good too. My only complaint is if you sit indoors its pretty cramped. I was elbowed in the head at least 2 times, but on the plus side the waiter was good looking. Fish tacos are a little bland. \n",
      "Decent prices too.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The short rib tacos are the bomb diggity! Never knew you could put rib meat into tacos, but I'm glad they invented it. Perfectly sweet with a nice tangy finish. Rich and diverse. Excellent mouthfeel too - that short rib was tender and moist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish tacos sucked though. It's a catch of the day dish, and today's was baja. We got grilled (as opposed to battered) at the recommendation of our server. It looked kinda bland, tasted bland (reminiscent of overlooked and browned scrambled eggs) and was soggy to the point where the soft tortilla fell apart in my hands and I had to eat the taco ashamedly with a fork and knife. Save your fish taco cravings for seven lives in Kensington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guac and chips appetizer was real nice. The guac comes in a nice stone mortar (great looking touch), and comes in three spicy levels: mild medium spicy. The spicy level has the perfect kick to it - spicy, but not overbearing. The chips are homemade and fried - hint of egg, and real tasty, although some -very few- were a bit too oily).\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend's recommended the Mexican iced tea. Apparently delicious and strong. Gonna have to get next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall experience was really good! Ordered the enchiladas suizas filled with pork and it was delicious...I cleaned the plate inc. all rice and beans.  For 15$ you can't go wrong.  Also shared the beef shortrib tacos and that's where I had to give it a 4\\/5.  The meat hands down delicious,  the hard taco shell on the other hand was greasy and tasted like old oil.  Too bad I was looking forward to it.  All desserts were good too...sample a bit of each!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Adoro el lugar!\n",

      "\n",
      "This time, we made reservation a couple of hours before, and went there on a Thursday. What we didn't know, is that they have two locations really close of each other. So, we ended up walking back to Playa Cabana.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the decoration and the patio. They have a trendy, modern, mexican-cantina vibe. Which was reflected in that delicious \"paloma\" I drank. It hasn't been common for me to find this drink abroad. Never thought I would find it in the perfect proportion of authentic ingredients. This paloma, was the best cocktail appetizer I had this year.\n",

      "TACOS DE LANGOSTA\n",
      "Palomas, tequila, and beer!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was really cool that they serve the salsa and the guacamole on the \"molcajetes\". The guacamole had too much lime for my taste, but the salsa was perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite item was: tacos de pulpo. A shame they treat them like appetizers, because they would be awesome like main course. The flavor hypnotized me, but they were only two, too small and with just one tortilla. I wanted to order more, but I was afraid it was going to be too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tacos de langosta where the ones I didn't like much. Too greasy, messy and blah. The hardshell tastes like a bunuelo (fried bread), not like tortilla. You can't hold them, cut them or bite them in peace. They had enough lobster, but they lacked flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality and flavor of my other options was great. I recommend them.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I dream about this place. Their guacamole and bottomless chips are addictive. My friends and I devoured two orders of it and they just kept asking us if we wanted more chips. Um, yes. Never stop giving them to me. The enchiladas suizas are amazing, and the jarritos are a nice non-alcoholic option. The tres leches cake makes me want to cry, it's so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a tiny place so make sure to have reservations, and it's good to note that it can get very loud. If you can deal with a somewhat cramped and lively space for the fantastic food, then you need to try this place.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "***1\\/2 stars\n",

      "Playa Cabana is nestled on a residential street at Davenport and Dupont.  Rumours about not being able to get in without a reservation are definitely true - even at lunch time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came here on a Friday afternoon around 1:30PM and the place was packed.  Just when hopes of a table came up, we were told the fellas at the bar had dibs on it.  I can see why because the bar was definitely cramped when it came to leg room in an already small restaurant.  I would say it seats no more than 40 and the servers really have to do a whole dance to maneuver around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one good thing that came of sitting at the bar is a full frontal view of the kitchen as well as one of the best bartenders in the city.  He was attentive, entertaining and makes, in my humble opinion, one of the best Mojitos in the city.  While you can opt for the traditional (made with rum) - tequila lovers can rejoice as he offers that as an alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sign on the wall proudly announces that they make their own soft shell corn tortillas in house - a bragging right that most restaurants cannot herald.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the Guaca Fresca ($8) which comes in mild, medium or spicy.  We opted for the spicy and didn't find it to be spicy.  The guac itself was rather bland, as were the chips.  A far cry from the lime-salted tortilla chips at Grand Electric.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also opted to share the Cubeta de Camaron ($16), a 1 lb bucket of shrimp tossed in an Arbol-garlic butter, Cancun style.  These were delicious.  I liked the spices and the shrimp were grilled to a nice pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "For mains we shared the Tacos de Pescado ($14) and went with the grilled option ($1 more).  All taco dishes come with 3 tacos though you can get 4 to make it more sharable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I simply couldn't leave without an order of Churros - or could I?  In the case of Playa Cabana, I am disappointed to say I could've skipped dessert. My expectation of an airy Churro rolled in cinnamon sugar was nowhere to be found.  Instead, a nightmare of a hard and overly sweet stick (which was probably re-fried) showed up on my plate.  Suffice it to say that this was one (rare) occasion where I didn't finish dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our meal came up to about $69 net of tip.  While I really enjoyed the bucket of shrimp and the tacos were delicious and fresh; as a whole Grand Electric is still my favourite joint when I'm in the mood for Mexican.  The weak points of my meal here were definitely the guac and the Churros.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the sign above the large communal table read \"Todo chido\" (it's cool).  I'll likely be back to try out their burritos in the near future.\n"

      "I had a margarita that did not contain simple syrup.(can't remember the name, but it is the second on the margarita list)  It was tart and delicious.  BTW this is an authentic style place, so there are no frozen margaritas.  This suited me just fine.  It's not summer anymore!\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Playa Cabana is a Mexican restaurant in Toronto open for lunch and dinner near the popular Yorkville area. They have three locations but I frequent original the 111 Dupont location.There are a few really great Mexican restaurants in Toronto but what I love about Playa Cabana is that it isn't a nutritional death sentence. There are quite a few pretty healthy options that are delicious and filling. The food is fresh and well priced. They also have a great tequila selection and delicious homemade chips. The space is small and cosy and in the summer they have a small patio in the back.\n",
      "The burrito is big enough to share and I would recommend sharing a little bit of everything. Their ceviche is always fresh and bursting with citrus. The brisket tacos are incredible but very heavy. This is a great place for a fun group dinner, boozy brunch or casual dinner. Strongly recommend getting a reservation.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Finally a decent Mexican restaurant in Toronto. A friend wanted to get some Mexican food, so I yelped and found this gem. \n",
      "\n",
      "Place\\/Ambience: small and gets busy everyday. Went on a Monday night, weather was bad and it was raining, but this place was still packed and there were people lining to get a table. We were a group of 8 and got seats because we went early at 6pm. The ambience was good. A little dim, but that is perfect for a social gathering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food:  We did not know what to get and asked our waiter for recommendations. He was very patient and told us the popular dishes, while explaining how each is cooked. I got the Tacos Al Pastor upon his suggestion. The pork was marinated overnight and slowly cooked. It was very good and very flavourful, although the portion was not very big. I also ordered the Mojito Cubana. Not the best mojito I tried, and was a bit on the sour side. My advice, skip the mojitos.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a very hidden place on Dupont street. It looks like a random quite house from the outside, but when you entered, it turns a very busy pub. I ordered the burrito and I like it! It's full of juicy, good quality beef, black beans, and rice. I've never seen any burrito would give me that much beef though! And they drizzled two different sauces, gives the burrito two totally different taste. Very entertaining!\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went here for lunch on a saturday. We ordered the fish tacos and chicken tacos and the civiche. The civiche was really good just a small portion. The tacos were really good too although for the price the portion was kind of small. We had churros for dessert and it wasn't that amazing but it wasn't disappointing either. The waitor was alright not amazing customer service.\n",

For Bocaditos we ordered the holy coupling of Guaca Fresca along with Fresh Salsa both served in lava rock molcajete bowls.  Eating guac and salsa this good and piquantly fresh, it was hard not to take advantage of refills for the delightfully crisp hand-pressed tortilla chips.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For mains I got the Baja Style Tacos De Pescado which are soft shell fish tacos fresh battered with Tecate-cerveza.  Mmmmmm, so far I can say these are the best fish tacos I've ever had with just the right ratio of light crumbly crisp batter encasing mouthwatering Tilapia.  My girlfriend ordered the day special of a three taco sampler of chicken, carnitas and brisket and was literally gasping between bites whilst singing their savoury praises.\n",

The tacos are delicious and perfectly sized, and the drinks are always great. It's a pretty tight spot so expect to be seated very close to your neighbors! We had one experience here with incredibly sub-par service, but every other time the servers have been attentive and helpful. Great spot!\n",

      "That said, you could immediately feel the warmth and coziness of Playa (from herein called PC). I know this place is busy, so I called to make a reservation and even then we had to wait for their brand new back patio. It was definitely worth it!  Note: this was at 9 p.m. on a Monday night on a holiday weekend so if you're coming here on a weekend come very early. \n",

      "Back to the back patio: it's very cute! They've got outside heat lamps and trees that make it very intimate and the ideal second date place (good Mexican food deserves to be reserved for date deux or trois). They can also accommodate groups as well and have high tops. It works! \n",

      "Everything had plenty of accoutrements (including more guac, bestill our heart). \n",

The shortrib taco was too though, as mentioned by the many Yelpers before me, incredibly oily. I should have heeded the warning because, after 2 tacos, the grease was too much for me and the 3rd taco was left uneaten. Still, a yummy choice for those that don't mind the oily fingers afterwards. \n",

      "My Original 3.5 Star review is below - but it is high time I revised.  My husband, yep no longer the BF he was below, and I are at Playa fairly regularly after buying a house up the street.  I have found my love for it and never had a negative experience since our first visit.  Food remains excellent, crowd fun and we always sneak a seat at the bar rather than deal with the clunky tables.  My new go to orders are the Salad with Pork - Yum and the Michilatas(Sp) - also never miss the Guac and the Spicy Mole...go and enjoy and Yeah Playa for being such a great place in our hood.\n",

      "OLD REVIEW....for context\n",
      "I am breaking with the crowd a bit - but bear with me.  This is a 3.5 (a strong one...and worth trying...but still not top rated)\n",
      "\n",
      "Food is really good, really fresh and authentic.  Definitely a step up from the Mexican places in T.O. that I have tried in the past.  I loved the guacamole and the spicy chicken mole was unbelievable.  We waited a few weeks to get a dinner reservation and in the end decided to try for brunch instead.  I would love to go back for dinner, but they do book in advance.  And we are fun and all, but don't normally have margaritas at brunch, so will have to take the word of other reviews about how amazing they are. \n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd was neighbourhood and foodie visitors to the neighbourhood - nice and friendly vibe - crammed in like sardines so that helps!\n",
      "\n",
      "So why 3.5?\n",
      "1. the space is awkward \\/ tables are too big and place does not seem that clean to me.  They could fit way more people in if they changed the entry and got better tables...\n",
      "2. there was grit in our fish taco, so much that my bf thought he had broken his tooth\n",
      "3. Our service was VERY SLOW - not cool for brunch!\n",
      "\n",
      "We will be back, because I need to try the Margarita and I am a guac addict...and we live a few blocks away...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great little place, came here on a Sunday afternoon.  Not a lot of seating.  Started with a bottle of Sol, my friend had a margarita, which she said was excellent.  Nachos and salsa for starters, both made on site and both excellent.  I had chicken enchiladas, with black bean curd and rice, my friend had Octopus tacos (yep!).  Both were excellent.  Highly recommend this place, only drawback is lack of seating, which makes coming here on the fly a bit risky.\n",

      "Playa Cabana makes you feel like you're on vacation.  A vacation to the beach, via Dupont Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "We boldly rolled up to Playa Cabana with no reservations.  Group of 4.  One of my friends had had dreams of tacos the previous night, so we were willing to wait it out to address her subconscious culinary cravings.  While kicking around the front patio (there's little room at the bar inside, and the front patio has yet to secure a liquor license, so it was a lot of sweating, foot shuffling, and debating how hot we'd want our guacamole as we stood around) we made friends with those waiting around us.  Consensus?  Playa Cabana is worth the wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we made it in (victorious!) we were led through the restaurant.  It's a tight space, and certainly not the most convenient flow.  Blame my overheated body, but A\\/C felt nonexistent.  Solution?  PITCHER OF MARGARITAS POR FAVOR (we opted for the tequila and orange mix).\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was simultaneously frenetic and casual, which in a way really suited the place.  Our server was really friendly, smiled with a twinkle in his eye when we ordered the guacamole spicy (it lived up to its name) and was as attentive as he could be given the many tables and the extremely tight space (which really means, I guess: he wasn't easy to locate, but we were having so much fun that it didn't really matter).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food-wise we tackled the (grilled) Baja-style fish tacos and the crispy chicken tacos, rounding off the order with some churros for dessert.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if this review's enthusiasm comes care of the tequila, but: the food was dynamite.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The guacamole, served in a molcajete, was predominantly smooth with a few chunks and some heat.  The accompanying chips were canola oil fried house-made corn tortillas.  They were on the greasier side, but I'm saying that...as a positive thing.\n",
      "The fish tacos were fresh, and light, and flavourful, with the softness of the fish set against the crunch of the slaw.\n",
      "The crispy chicken tacos were messier (I had to resort to my knife and fork) but the crispy shell was the perfect complement to the soft free-range chicken\n",
      "Churros, well: fried dough is alright by me.  But this was cinnamon-y, sugary, dulce de leche-kissed fried dough.  Mo' bettah.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Worth a special note: Playa Cabana seems determined to show that Mexican food can be healthy.  Fresh salsas, locally sourced dairy, free range chicken, and black and pinto beans cooked in veggie stock (the latter are re-seared with lean pork stock so don't stay vegetarian throughout the process).  Healthy tastes delicious here.  \n",
      "\n",

      "The best guac I've had here in Toronto! Tucked just east of Davenport on Dupont, I found Playa Cubana yesterday for lunch and was very impressed. Though the street-front patio is a little cramped, the food and service were excellent. I think I've found my new favourite Mexican place. Can't wait to try the ceviche'!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So so busy.  Seriously.  Really, really busy.  But great and completely worth the wait.  Some of the best Mexican food I've found in the city so far.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, the food IS as good as everyone's been saying. I would definitely eat there again, but I wouldn't recommend the back patio in the winter time - unfortunately this was our only option as the front room was packed.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Playa is typically Toronto. Five star food, the right amount of cool factor to make it \"in demand\" and great food. Go for the fresh fish tacos, the corn on the cob and the cointreau tequila.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We were driving back from a cottage in Brighton and wanted to pick up food to eat at home. You know, avoid having to make food when we're already so tired? Playa Cabana was on our way and it's one of those spots that we've wanted to try out, but just haven't gotten to.\n",
      "We popped in and ordered the chicken and pastor (soft) tacos and a horchata for while we waited on our order.\n",
      "I found the service to be friendly and overall efficient and extremely fast. The food was done before we even got through half the drink. The horchata, while good, was not as great as we've had elsewhere in the city. I found that it was at once refreshing going down the throat but leaving your mouth with a dry feeling (which made you think you were thirsty).\n",
      "Later when we got home to eat, the shells were coming apart a bit (likely from condensation) but the meat was amazing. The pastor is a bit spicy but delicious and the chicken balanced out the spiciness of our meal.\n",
      "While there, we discussed how the location was compact which created a sense of intimacy, but it wasn't romantic in the classic sense, making it a great spot for new dates. We will return to dine in someday, and hopefully have a chance to visit the other Playa locations, to be able to compare all of them!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Walked in between the lunch time & dinner time rush and immediately got seated at our table. While the place is quite cramped, it had that semi-cozy & loud cantina feel that I felt for a minute that I was in a busy cantina somewhere in Mexico!\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a pitcher of the \"amber\" margarita, crab cakes, chicken tinga tostadas, grilled fish tacos and the tres leches cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crab cakes were on the small side, yet really appetizing that led  us to crave for more of what's to come. Both the chicken tinga tostadas (2 pcs) and the grilled fish tacos (3 pcs) were really really fresh and tasty. I also liked their variation of chili sauces on the table (chopped fresh chilies, chili chipotle, red and green sauces), and yes they were indeed HOT - which were perfect to complement any dish you order. The highlight of the meal was the amazing tres leches cake - satisfyingly moist, decadent, and refreshing all at the same time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the food looked like they were not much portion-wise, but don't let that deceive you. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have an amazingly tasty and authentic food with great ambience, it'll make you forget you're stil in the city!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We got takeout from this place a while back. Overall, I quite enjoyed the food. It would be a 5 star place if their prices where maybe 20-25% lower. We ordered the following items:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS\n",
      "This was pretty tasty but very messy to eat. Sauce and grease everywhere. I would order it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "- POLLO MILANESA CHIPOTLE BURRITO\n",
      "This was really good. Better than the tacos IMO.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm a Texan and my girlfriend is from San Diego, so we know good Mexican when we eat it, and this is excellent Mexican. The dishes were fresh and authentic, and I can't recommend the Margaritas highly enough. Splurge a little and try some of the more expensive blends - seriously the best margaritas I've ever had.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Was a humid evening and we decided to sit on the patio. We were lucky to get the best seats on the patio, without any wait. That's surprising given how small the place is and that we had not made reservations. Each of us got a drink and we decided to try the home made salsa  and guacamole. \n",
      "\n",
      "We get our drinks and the apps and are having a good conversation. 5 minutes later, to our terrible luck, it starts pouring. We ask the server if he could move us to a table inside. The place is an converted home, so I'm worried we won't be seated for a while. Meanwhile, couple of my friends barely moved. Yes, the salsa was that good. Spectacular to say the least. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server moved us inside within 5 minutes and we didn't complain. We placed orders and the food took about 15-20 minutes. The server spoke highly of the baja fish tacos, but I was a little disappointed. I think it could have used some more flavor. The chicken tacos were surprisingly better. One of my friends got the huevos rancheros which was an enormous portion and was quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a great experience. Will definitely go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Having heard nothing but great things, and with my foodie boyfriend in town for only one more night, I knew this was our best bet for a date night. We called several times earlier in the day, but couldn't get through. After booking a reservation elsewhere, I called one last time. I was told they had 48 requests for reservations overnight and a table was unlikely. They sensed my disappointment and offered to wait list us and call if something came up. An hour later they called with availability for 2. Yesss!\n",
      "We arrived early and ordered a margarita while we waited for our table. The hostess recommended the Amber Margarita, it was a great choice If your looking to stick to the classics, not too sweet. One was enough. \n",
      "Now seated and keeping with our preference of asking waiters for recommendations, we ordered Guacamole Fresca and Ceviche of the Day (Marlin) as apps and Ancho Braised Brisket Tacos for him and Chile Rellenos for me. \n",
      "Our eyes were exceedingly bigger than our bellies. Next time we will share an entrée, or skip the apps altogether, but wanting to explore the menu as much as possible, we ordered and took a doggie bag for the next days lunch. \n",
      "The guacamole was good... fresh, flavorful and not too garlicky. The medium heat was more like mild, next time I'll give the hot a try. \n",
      "The ceviche was a little disappointing. Coming off a trip to San Francisco where I had excellent ceviche at Fresca for the first time, my standards were maybe a bit high. The blend was fresh and citrusy, with a great kick of heat. I would have preferred if the fish was more tender and not chopped into the same small cubes as everything else in the mix. Also, it might be because I got my tortilla fill on the guac, but I would have preferred the ceviche was served with plantain chips for variation. \n",
      "The tacos were some of the best I've had. Smokey and tender meat filled the flaky, soft shells. Served with their delicious seasoned rice, crema and salsa, it was the perfect Mexican meal. At least until we tried the oaxacan cheese stuffed rellenos. Breaded, fried, and placed on top of creamy tomato sauce, it was mouthwatering. With the rice, guac and salsa at its side, it was the perfect mix of flavours and textures. The only problem with this entree is that it made me regret ordering the apps because I could only have a few bites before feeling completely stuffed. \n",
      "I cannot wait to go back, intentionally order less, so I can fully enjoy my entire meal while it's hot and fresh. Service was good. The vibe is casual and cool, mixed with authentic Mexican decor.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for my sister's birthday with a group of her friends, note: this is not a place for large group (ie. anything more than 2 people).\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was good.  Fresh ingredients, good size portions, flavourful, simple and made with love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was attentive, polite and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a tequila bar, so don't expect a wide selection of scotch or vodka.  Their cocktails are creative and bring out the different tequila flavours. \n",
      "\n",
      "The space is where they lack and the \"intimate\" setting just gets annoying.   Because of proximity to everything else in the restaurant, it gets loud and it was hard to maneuver around especially since there was a group of us.  So if you're claustrophobic, wait till you get a seat on the patio. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, it's a bit pricey, but affordable considering the area.  It's about $8 for a plentiful side of guacamole and chips and $13 for tacos.  Which as I'll say again and again in my review of taco places- is too much for street food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Parking is difficult, street parking only, but the subway is about 2 blocks away.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you're looking for a spin on Mexican food, this is the place! Hidden gem , would highly recommend. The only downside to my experience here is the location, it is EXTREMELY tight. I am not usually one to complain for small intimate restaurants, but this place is just too small for comfort.\n"

      "I'm a big fan of Milagro as it was formerly the only real Mexican food I had access to, so I'm really happy Playa Cabana has opened up. The menu is divided up into appetizers, tacos, burritos, and house specials, that includes entrees that don't fit into the other categories, such as huevos rancheros, tostadas, and carne asada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guacamole and nachos reminded me of Milagro, but with the option to add spice to it. Honestly though, I like Milagro's guac better, first because they give you a larger portion and second, at Playa Cabana I couldn't taste the other flavours in the guac too much, possibly because we ordered it spicy. The nachos were awesome though, and still warm from the oven (or more likely, the fryer).\n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered the chorizo sausage which was smothered in the best tasting sauce I've ever had.  The whole table was dipping their nachos in the sauce after the chorizo was done.  The sausage itself was pretty lean, and I'm a fan of fatty meat, but for a lean sausage, it was pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taco dishes come with three small tacos each for about $12. If you're hungry, get the rice and beans on the side for another $2.  The corn tortillas the tacos are made with is fresh and delicious, and the filling (I got skirt steak and chorizo) is okay. They did not disappoint me but did not stand out either.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burrito dishes are huge portions, so it feels much more satisfying to eat than the tacos.  The sauces on the burrito really made it good, and better than the tacos in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert I had a spicy mole gelato that was absolutely delicious. It was rich and chocolatey with a tiny kick of spice at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "To drink, try the agave margarita.  It has orange and lime juice and no sugar, just agave nectar.  In my opinion, Playa Cabana's margaritas are perfectly made. They also have Jarritos pop and Mexican pop made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup - you actually CAN taste a difference!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend making a reservation here. The place is small, and was rammed the entire night.  I can't wait until summer when the patio is open - you will definitely find me there, sipping margaritas.\n",

      "\n",
      "The ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS were the best... Hands down. The crispy shells were drenched in beef juice, the meat was soft and tender.. And it came out fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Baja Tacos, and they were good - the tortillas were not the freshest and it was a little stale. Fish tho was great and complimented well with onions, avocado and mayo (I believe). \n",

Food-wise it is fresh as it get here in the cold gloomy north; quality comparable to some of the Mexican stuff I recall dabbling in whilst in Los Angeles (though I am certainly no authority of \"authentic\" Mexican food at all). But damn they big! Flavours and textures were bursting as we bit into our overstuffed (maybe way too overstuffed) tacos and tuna ceviche. Good grilled flavour in the chorizo in my taco.

      "\n",
      "We started off the meal with homemade chips and salsa. I wish there was an endless bowl of each for me to munch on all day and all night. The salsa was bright and fresh with just enough heat to slap your tongue around. The chips were warm and crisp and the perfect vehicle to get the salsa to your month. Next came the chicken tostadas and ancho braise short rib tacos. The chicken tostadas came piled hight with guac and crema with some black beans thrown into the mix to give the meal some weight. The surprise of the dish though, the rice! I chased down every single grain of rice that was on that plate. The short ribs had a delicious depth of flavour that was balance by the pico de gallo. \n",

      "\n",
      "We shared a lot of dishes...but let's start with drinks. I had a rum mojito which was awesome (my fav drink after all) and my hubby had the bacon infused bourbon sour which was aaaawesome. He then had a Mexican iced tea which was strong and delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: We started with crab cakes, chorizo, flautas. The crab cakes were amazeeee and the flautas were crispy, creamy, tangy. Just really good. The chorizo was ok. Nothing amazing. \n",

      "\n",
      "Service was good. We got a lot of attention (it helps that the resto has like 10 tables and there was 3-4 servers) but still very appreciated. It is loud but not so much that you can't socialize. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I absolutely love this place! Playa Cabana is tucked away from the main hustle and bustle of downtown (yet is still close by) so you feel as if you discovered a local joint that only the who's who knows about. The restaurant is on a quiet street among homes and there is a really cute patio in front that you can imagine being packed on a hot summers day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside is so cozy and charming that you know you're just going to love the place. But the food is so yummy and BIG and satisfying. The burrito's are MONSTER and the length of one full arm so beware of food-coma after. The ceviche is refreshing and light and perfect for sharing. I had the Chile Relleno which is one of my favorite Mexican dishes: fried pepper (with egg batter) with cheese and glorious filling inside. YUM!\n",
      "It doesn't matter how full you are, the Tres Leche cake is divine. Rich, moist cake topped with whipped cream (O.M.G!) Must have no matter what.\n",

Last time I came, I ordered the fish taco (fried) and pork sausage with roasted pineapple taco.  Loved the fish taco (meaty and flaky), but felt the pork sausage was overly salty, though the pineapples were a nice touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pricing seems reasonable (3 tacos starting at $15). I thought the cocktails were overpriced ($13 and up), and did not order any.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was told by my friends that this is one of the best Mexican restaurants for tacos. I checked it out today and I can say that it is indeed pretty good. In the summer they have an awesome patio, which is always packed. Even though it's kinda small, the atmosphere is very intimate. Their mojito is one of the best in Toronto and they make it with either rum or tequila. I tried a tequila-based mojito and it was a little sour, but tasted pretty good. Their tacos are $13 for 3. They're tasty and well worth the trip. However, my #1 choice for tacos would still be Barrio Coreano located at 642 Bloor Street West. I give Playa Cabana a solid 4-star rating because they totally deserve it. Next time, I'll make sure to check out Playa Cabana Hacienda.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The good: Housemade corn chips. Tasty, fresh guac. Zesty beverage (Playa Paloma). Friendly, efficient service. Tacos de pescado. Insanely spicy hot sauce. Monster sized slice of tres leches cake. B-list Canadian celebrity sighting.\n",

      "The bad: Incredibly cramped seating.\n",

      "The ugly: Snobbish, disinterested hostess.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Playa Cabana had solid food. Loved that they took reservations, portions were good and the staff were very attentive. We started with the bucket of shrimp. \"Bucket\" is probably an overstatement, but still delicious. We then ordered the beef tacos and fried fish tacos - the beef was better. The churros were good but I thought was over priced. Overall, loved Playa Cabana (especially in comparison to its sister Hacienda restaurant).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pretty delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Went labour day monday and the place was packed. despite making a 7pm reservation, had to wait for another 20 for a table... not shocking, considering the place is teeny. i was a bit annoyed, but felt better once we grabbed a drink at the bar. the bartender was pretty rad, and made a pretty delicious drink which was off-menu (because i asked for something with Tromba Tequila). \n",

      "\n",
      "what a relief when my partner dug in and said that it was delicious. what's even better is that he tried mine and thought that next time he would order what i ordered.\n",
      "i thought that the mole was awesome. not too sweet, just the right amount of savoury...and the filling was mushrooms and zucchini all marinated and soft. yum!\n",

      "Food: I heard their bun bo hue was delicious so I went with that. Usually it's spicy so I asked for less spicy and it was perfect! The broth was delicious. I wish they had the pigs blood with it but it was good nonetheless. My friend ordered pho and we shared an order of banh coun - pretty decent. $6.50 for a good amount to share with some sausage. \n",

      "Service: pretty good. Fast paced environment. Can't complain!\n",

      "\n",
      "This place is excellent, and very small, it has smaller portion sizes then most Vietnamese places, but the soup it self is so good, that having a cavernous amount of soup is not important. The Vietnamese spring rolls are good, although a bit doughy. I will be back to try some of the other dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm a serious Pho Lover, so when I heard about this place from the locals and saw the reviews, checking it out was a must. Ginger Gent and I ordered chicken and beef Pho ....to go in order to have date night by the fire. It such a wonderful surprise to get home and find the soup separated from the meat and noodles, which is ideal since you don't want your noodles super soggy. Needless to say the Pho was great and the smell is completely intoxicating.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "This place is very small. We must have gotten there at the right time, because by the time we got our food (which was light speed quick) there was a lineup at the door. People didn't seem to mind to wait, either. That's a good sign!\n",
      "\n",
      "They do not get 5 stars for service, they didn't return to the table once, but I honestly didn't expect them to. It's an in-and-out kinda place. \n",

      "I will definitely be back, very very soon. Definitely a hit in my books.\n"

      "My epic quest for the Toronto's best pho noodle house has landed me in another spot... somewhat off the beaten track from east or west chinatown. Pho Linh is a small vietnamese restaurant located at College and Dufferin; a little cluster of vietnamese shops and restaurants in the midst of the surrounding portuguese enclave. Recently renovated, Pho Linh delivers one of the better Pho's in downtown Toronto. It's money baby!\n",
      "\n",
      "Broth: lightly coloured, but sweet and rich in flavor. not overly salty, unlike other places in town. soup comes garnished with a healthy topping of scallions and cilantro always a pleasant sight to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noodles: slightly wider but I think it's because these are actually fresh rice noodles instead of the typical rice sticks used-they taste uberly fresh too. the only FRESH noodles I've come across amongst the pho joints downtown!\n",
      "\n",
      "Herb plate: saw and basil on hand; definite plus and lime wedge. more places should offer saw though not a dealbreaker for me so long as the broth is on point\n",
      "\n",
      "Beef: My only beef is with the beef BUT  only because it is not as paper thin as I like my beef to be, good quality eye of round used.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also tried their banh cuon - unique vientnamese rice flour crepes filled with wood ear mushrooms and ground pork topped with fried shallots, cilantro and bean sprouts served with a side of fish sauce and vietnamese sausage. Delish! The thin, delicate rice flour sheets add a melt in your mouth contrast to the savory filling and the fried shallots provide a pleasant pop on top. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the menu is extensive-bun, broken rice and specialty soups are available as well and the prices are in keeping with most vietnamese joints around town. But man! I think I have another winner for pho in Toronto! At least this is a pho worth enduring the slow service of the 506 streetcar for.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came to this place with an old friend. I ordered the Special Pho with everything in it the service was fast and effcient. I've been dying to go back I'd have to say my pho was hot and steamy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be back this was worth a trip before work or after for dinner. Next time I'm up in the area I'll be sure to try this place again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My one of my favourite place to go for bun cuon and pho bo kho!!! The bun coun here is by far the best in Toronto and I've been to many.  Unlike many other restos, there is a very generous amount of filling (ground pork and mushroom) in each roll and it's so flavourful! We also order the spring roll and bo kho (spicy stew beef) which wasn't spicy all. It had a very tasty broth that has been simmered with carrots and very very tender beef cubes. Just thinking about it makes it want to go back for another bowl tomorrow.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Love coming here! Always busy but not a long wait to get a table. Service is fast and friendly. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Today I took it upon myself to try out this pho place as I've been to about 10 different places around Toronto. First off, don't come here with any vegetarians, as they have little to no selection for veggie pho. At most pho places I order the Rare beef \\/ beef ball rice noodle. It came very quick and I was so impressed with the noodle to meet ratio. I've been severely let down by most places around Toronto for this reason. Too much broth not enough good stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "The broth was delicious right to the end and the amount of meat was amazing. I'd say this is one of the better if not best pho places in Toronto. However two things threw me off (hence the not so perfect score) - There was not a mini dish to fill a little rooster sauce mix to dip the meat into, so I used one of the spoons. There was a fruit fly in the ice cold tea (since it's hot out now). Kinda a bummer, but the delicious pho stands true.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What the heck did I eat here? I'm drawing a blank on the viet name already, but it was S3 (special #3) which is only served on Monday-Thursday. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a stew with spicy broth, roasted carrots and big pieces of stewed beef. Noodles were thick. Beef and broth were delicious, a bit fatty but that's what makes it tasty. I didn't like the noodles\\/broth ratio, way too many noodles and not enough broth! mmm broth\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have \"Hue Style\" pho on Friday-Sunday only, which I'd like to try out. Good winter foodage!\n",
      "\n",
      "Service OK, food brought out very quickly (YES!!!) and prices pretty cheapo.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Let me start by saying that the food here is delicious and authentic. Fantastic taste experience. The rest however is what you'd expect from an Asian hole-in-the-wall kind of place. In short, get in and out, but definitely get in because if you really like Phó, the flavours are fantastic!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place pho is very good. Their pho broth is good. Price is inexpensive. The place is very small and loud. This is not a good place if you want to relax and enjoy your meal. When they are very busy, there will a line out the door. Avoid going in the weekends and lunch hours.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here is very delicious! Like many other people said its like a no-frills restaurant cash only! One time I had to pay for my friend so don't forget! But overall I would rate 4 stars. Plus I play basketball near here so it is a very nice place to go after a workout like that!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was probably my favourite pho place in Toronto as they use fresh noodle and ingredients.  The place seems like it had been undergone renovation recently so it looks more comfy dining in.  Their weekend special is bun bo hue which is always my favour.  But during my last visit I feel some components are missing such as coagulated pig blood and bun bo hue itself still tastes delicious but more of satay flavour.  I didn't taste much of shrimp paste in the soup as well.  The pho itself is still my favour in Toronto, the broth is light and perhaps not as flavourful as pho at Thinh Thanh, but they use flat rice noodle unlike many other places in Toronto that use dry vermicelli type.  Another item worth mentioning is pho bo kho, very very flavourful and yummy.  But they only serve that btw Mon-Thu.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price is reasonable and may have to wait in the line up during weekend lunch rush, but thankfully the wait time is always short due to quick turnaround time.  Overall a solid 4\\/5\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pretty average pho place. Broth was not as flavourful as others I've had before but the noodles were very nice. They are quite generous with the meat portions. Spring rolls were some of the best I've ever had. Very reasonable prices. Good service. I wouldn't go out of my way to return as I do have other favourite pho places in the city however if I was in the area I definitely would stop by!\n",

      "I'm from Scarborough and have my go-to spot so when I had made plans to meet up with a friend who lives in the area, I of course relied on good ol' yelp. This was the top rated so I thought, of course, why not? \n",
      "\n",
      "Place is small and busy, but we were seated immediately. I read another review about the service level dropping closer to the end of the night and they weren't kidding. Though, it didn't really put a damper to our dining experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Spring Rolls - Very crispy wrap yet the inside was a little on the dryer side. Thankfully, it came with the usual sauce. 4\\/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pho with rare beef and beef balls - One of my usual picks at any Pho place. The broth was nice though I did flavour it with Oyster sauce and Sriracha. Am really now realizing that it was crazy salty as I'm thirsty AF. But it was still pretty good. Would I go back? Sure, if I were in the area again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. 4\\/5\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Best pho restaurant in Toronto! Very authentic and the staff are super friendly (although they merely just greet you and bring you your order). My love and I go there at least once or twice per week. We tried other pho places and it's just not the same... Try the veggie\\/tofu pho and the spicy hue noodle (it's only available on the weekends though). Oh and they're owned operated by actual Vietnamese as oppose to Chinese...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is DAMN DELICIOUS!  It is probably my favourite pho place that I've tried in Toronto.\n",
      "\n",
      "The broth is delicious, the noodles they use are super smooth and delicious and the portions are large.  The service is fast and the food is a very good price.  The area is not the nicest and unless you're in the area or found it on Yelp it's not a place I could see someone going out of their way to try but it's worth making the trek out here.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love this place, one of my favorites in the West end. I like that their noodles a little wider and fresh. They are pretty quick, and the broth is consistent. For those of you who enjoy their soup on the spicier side, they have a couple chilli oil jars kicking around. which is a big bonus for me, seeing as i bring my own sometimes to pho places that don't have them. i'm pretty much a regular there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After hearing raving reviews from my friends, I had to come try this place out. Apparently they're known for their bun bo hue and their banh cuon. And today I was craving a hot bowl of noodles so I decided to come here and see what my friends were talking about. My cousin and i came here around 4pm and already a lot of tables were occupied. We ended up getting a table by the window. I opened the menu and the first thing I saw was the bun bo hue (it's a weekend special fri-sun). So we ordered that plus the banh cuon. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the banh cuon arrived, I was so excited to try it. I've never had it before but it's like rice roll with pork. The rice roll itself is very thin and is sticky and when dipped into fish sauce...heaven! The bun bo hue tasted a bit different but in a good way. At other places it had too much of a lemongrass flavour to it. But this was different, there was a subtle taste of lemongrass plus other flavours. This was also spicy! I'm glad I tried this place out. I heard their other pho are amazing as well and I'd definitely come back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "They take cash* only!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's the best Pho restaurant in the area, so I highly recommend coming here if you're near. It's pretty small inside, so expect to wait for a table during prime eating hours. I believe they only accept cash. People come here because their food is of good value (tasty yet not too expensive). Their decor is nothing to write home about. I believe the restaurant is named after a Vietnamese singer, who happens to be the owner's sister. There is free parking on the surrounding side streets, or paid meter parking on College Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always order either the pho or banh cuon, or both!  Their bun bo hue is pretty OK.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My pho go to place. On weekends they have bun Bo hue which is my favourite. The servers are super friendly and I love their soup base. The place gets packed on weekends but the wait is fairly fast.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Though it was busy, we got there just in time to score a pair of seats.  The high turnover in customers meant we would have waited only a short while but who wants to wait when your hungry!\n",
      "There were two Pho places within spitting distance from each other.  The Phoenix was empty but Pho Lihn was packed.  Always go where the crowd goes - they must know something and with high turn over means fresh food...I hope!\n",
      "This has got to be one of the best Pho I've had.  The broth wasn't the MSG laden mixture that is sweet and salty at once and dries you up from the inside out.  The spring roll was pretty good but the cold roll left something to be desired.\n",
      "One note, the place kind of smelled and the cleanliness comes into question.  I did my best to sanitize my utensils before eating.  Oh well, with that many people eating there, I guess it was worth the risk!\n",
      "The service is brisk and efficient and we had a good night.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "3.5\\/5, +.5 for service\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to try Pho Linh after seeing the photos on Yelp and wanting to try the Banh Canh Cua...but it's only available Monday to Thursday! Since I went on a Friday I was a little taken aback...but decided to order the small house special noodle soup, and vow to myself I will return for a second visit regardless of this visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food came quite fast; about 4 minutes after I ordered. I liked the broth and the beef ingredients, but the noodles were a little overcooked and broke apart quite easily. They also use the slightly wider type of noodles, instead of the more narrow kinds you're used to in other Pho restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was excellent for a Vietnamese restaurant, and they actually said hello, thank you, and explained the fact they only had my original requested order from Mondays to Thursdays, and joked around with me saying I should come back on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heh. I'll keep this place in mind for sure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "One of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants. I like their specials (spicy soup on the weekend, and stew soup on weekdays). They have good rice dishes and they make their banh cuon on location.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We never would have tried Pho Linh based on its location and outside appearance -- a bit of a barren stretch on College before Dufferin, the sign reminds of those bad, small town diners that serve frozen fries and hockey puck burgers under guise of \"home cookin'\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, yelpers recommend it and we thought we'd take a break from Pho Phuong and try a new place.  It helps that it's equidistant from our house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambience is low key, very quiet, no multi-TV distraction (YAY!!!), and clean, though the menus were a bit skuzzy.  I blame the youth of today.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we were sitting down, another couple arrived to a chance meeting with apparent acquaintances who had been enjoying a meal:  \"You've got good taste in restaurants!\" they remarked to their friends.  \"This is the place for Pho in TO.\"  How's that for a first impression upon arriving? \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway!\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the S3 and #13, with a bean shake to wash it down.  The server informed that, due to Monday being a holiday (Easter weekend), S3 was unavailable -- he seemed somewhat chagrined, as though he was offending me.  No worries!  I got the Hue style beef pho instead, which is their weekend offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heather went for the ol' standby of noodles, grilled pork, and spring roll with salad (nice greens, no crappy\\/wilty iceberg lettuce!) and her customary avocado milkshake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soup was very good, tasty though not extraordinary, and came with nice, thick rice noodles rather than the vermicelli style one normally sees -- this pleased me greatly!  I definitely prefer a more robust noodle, so they score points here.  The side of sprouts, basil, limi, and a chili was very generous... which is good, because I usually have to ask for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The banh cuon (I think that's the name) isn't normally my style, but it was good.  The odd little muffin thing topped with a fried shimp was damned tasty (I didn't bother with the shrimp... it was desiccated, though had served its purpose by imparting mucho flavour).  \n",
      "\n",

Not only is it my culture's food, but I have been surrounded by viet mothers who secretly cook competitively against each another my whole entire life. When I go out to have Vietnamese food, I don't expect a lot, I just expect it to be quick and tasty enough that I wouldn't pause and re think whether or not I want to take another bite.  I've heard a few things about pho linh and their infamous homemade banh pho. After having their bowl of pho, I can see what the rage is all about.  The banh pho is great, it tasted fresh and had the right amount of chewiness and matched perfectly well with the savory sweet soup. I also ordered the banh beo, which consists of small steamed rice cakes topped with chopped dried shrimp, scallions, mung bean paste, crispy fried shallots and nuoc mam (fish sauce). The texture of the banh beo was flawless, it wasn't soft and nor was it powdery (I've actually had banh beo made like this and it was not pleasant), I figured that if the banh pho was made well that the banh beo would come to par. Definitely a great Vietnamese establishment!\n",

Got it home, the broth was scalding hot still, so it perfectly cooked the beef. The noodles were the right texture, and the salad was fresh as can be, with no wilted brown tails on the bean sprouts. Really good flavour on the broth, although I agree with other posters that this is not one where the typical spices of anise and cardamom sing. Well rounded and meaty, it was still the perfect comfort food. I skipped my usual condiments doctoring, because it really didn't need it; the salt levels are bang on. While I didn't eat in, I did scope out the space. Not 100% clean, but not disturbingly dirty either. It had the sort of patina you'd expect from a place where customers are enthusiastically slurping down big bowls of soup. Will be back to try the bùn.\n",

This dish is very satisfying as it is cheap so it'll give you a run for your money! They also have a variety of genuine Vietnamese drinks that should be tried since you might not find them at any other Vietnamese restaurants such as che ba mau, suong sao etc. since the make time is a bit tedious. Spring rolls are also a must get appetizer as they are made crunchy with a delicious meat filling. My mouth is watering just talking about it.\n",

The bun is one of the best I've ever had - a delightful combination of textures and tastes, it includes your choice of protein, cucumber, mint, lettuce, roasted peanuts, as well as a really tasty Nuoc Cham sauce with slices of pickled carrot and daikon. The Nuoc Cham seems to be the Northern Vietnam variety - less garlicy and spicy than its southern counterpart. I like the grilled beef - it's slightly sweet and smoky, which I prefer to the shredded beef style (which always reminds me of catfood, so I never order it).\n",

I ended up ordering the Pho Bo Kho, a spicy beef stew noodle soup. Service was fast maybe because I was the only one there at 10 am. It came piping hot along with the requisite side of sprouts\\/herbs. The soup appeared oily but once you mix it around it's not that noticeable. But the taste was very flavorful. You know they took care & time to cook the broth down to this level of complexity. The rice noodles were the wide kind and soaked up the broth nicely. The beef brisket was a little gristly\\/fat but tender. I'm not a big fan of beef stew but this was damn amazing. I can't wait to come back for their Bun Bo Hue.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I would have to say that the only experience I ever had at this restaurant was not pleasant. The wait staff was very inattentive and somewhat cold and abrupt. The place didn't seem very clean and none of us at my table of five were very pleased with her food. We figured that since that been in business for a while they would have maybe perfected some of the beginning issues, but apparently they still hadn't gotten it right so we will not be returning or recommending this is a good restaurant as it would be a reflection on our taste.\n"

      "Was here for my nephew's wedding, this was the dinner following the rehearsal.  The staff as outstanding and super friendly.  Two great young ladies, to handle a room or 24 people and they did it with a smile.   The food was delicious.  I ordered sushi, but also got to pick from the wife's plate of Stir Fry, and both were spot on. I am sure as we visit my sis more and more, we will make a point of visiting here often.\n",

      "I've eaten here a number of times and every time I'm underwhelmed. To me it seems like the food is just bland and slightly over-priced. I will say, however, that some people I know really seem to enjoy it, so perhaps my tastes just aren't that good (or maybe I have more experience with this kind of food!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Atmosphere is quite nice, and the staff is pretty welcoming. If there were something better for this type of food in the area, I would have rated this place only 2 stars, but since this is about it, unless you want generic Chinese food, I'll give it 3.\n",

I stopped in to order take out and there were only two other tables in there. They told me it would be 5 minutes and brought out my order in less than that so that left me optimistic!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got home, the pad thai portion was huge! I'm talking probably enough for 3 servings but the flavor really didn't sing to me. It tasted good but nothing special so I had to add a bunch of sriracha and black pepper.  The food is definitely not authentic and unmemorable  but decent if you want a quick fix.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kind of a hit or miss place.  I am tired of these 3 in 1 Asian places.  Thai, Japanese, and Chinese...these kind of places aren't authentic and are not great at any of these. I rather have just a straight Thai place or something.\n",

The pad thai is no where close to authentic. Singapore noodles are not authentic either, but still tastes really good. Large portions of every entree helps them with the star rating.\n",

      "A pretty good place for sushi, and an average place for other Asian dishes.  While Red Bowl can be wonderful at times, it can be lackluster because of its large array of Asian dishes.  Dishes range from Mongolian to Japanese to Thai to Chinese...etc.  It's sort of like lumping all Europeans together and letting Spaniards cook your schnitzel and kraut.  Red Bowl would better themselves by refining dishes they are strongly familiar with.  \n",

We did  not notice that there empty tables on the other side of the restaurant until too late.  Service was nice, very polite and prompt, by an attentive waiter.   Noise was out of this world. No,  it was not music, it was the bartender a lady  that was being very loud with 2 patrons (or friends) for the entire duration of our dinner.  Not talking, but screaming and laughing loudly (around 8pm, so no alcohol induced).\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was OK, we ordered General Tsos, a House special fried rice, 2 different teas and a soup (tea was delicious, specially the jasmine tea), but left as soon as we could, and took our food home.  Not sure if we will give it another try.\n",

      "Saved us from a Sunday night of frozen pizza! It was 9 o'clock and our options for dinner were rapidly diminishing when the Red Bowl Asian Bistro popped up on my android restaurant finder. They were open til 10 so the decision was made. Our initial greeting by what looked to be the owner of all ppl was not one of excitement  or even welcome....but the service was friendly which I suppose is what matters. We had sushi to start with, because I am a weenie eater when it comes to sushi we had a California roll, which let's face it is hard to make wrong, and a Dragon roll, which was a hit with the rest of the table.  Our table ordered the Broccoli Beef and the Cashew Chicken both of which got middle of the road responses (we didn't take these leftovers home, which speaks volumes), we also had a simple Chicken Lo Mein which was delish (with the addition of some soy sauce) and the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken that was unique and very fresh.  Another big plus were the portion sizes, we all ordered individual dishes, but there was plenty to share, which is half the fun of dining out right?  \n",
      "\n",
      "On another note, they don't serve alcohol on Sundays (sniffle), but if you bring in your church bulletin, you get a free soda (hmmmm....).\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though half of the dishes failed to rock my world, the fact that the ingredients were fresh leads me to believe that after some investigation to weed out weak dishes, you'll be left with some pretty delicious Asian options when the mood strikes!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My first experience here was poor as the wait was very long. In all fairness, they had only just opened and they were exceptionally busy and they did not have the staff to handle the demand. I went back - although I told myself I never would - as I really want this place to be good. My second visit was much better. Our server was very knowledgeable and professional and the food was good. I have updated my rating from one star to three as this represents an average of my two experiences. I'll likely go back but I'm not ready to recommend this place to out-of-town folks just yet!!!\n",

      "This place was packed when we got in; although, being new and popular I expected this. Their was a lot of front of the house staff that didn't seem too in to their jobs. They just stood their chatting and playing around with each other. There were a few tables open but they were apparently being held for other people. \n",

      "First time here and probably the last.  Met friends who came up from out of town at 2pm on a Saturday.  Was told 30-35 minute wait for a table when we got there.  25 minutes later we were seated.  Pleasantly surprised, as I had read negative reviews about longer than expected wait times.  We waited a little longer than normal for our waiter to come by, and by that time we had already looked over the menu and were ready to order, so he took our drink and food order at the same time.  Didn't have to wait too long on drinks.  Our food came out about 50 minutes after we'd been seated.  Nothing to write home about.  It wasn't horrible  but I've had better burgers.  It was an enjoyable lunch with friends I hadn't seen in a while, but next time we'll meet in the burbs with plenty of free parking.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just another burger place. Not great, but not bad either. When we first got there, they stated that the wait would be between 30 to 45 minutes. I saw about 4 or 5 tables that were not occupied. Why such a long wait when there appears to be open tables? Are they reserved? Do you not like the way I look? I wanted to ask, but I figured since a few friends are with me, I didn't want to make a scene. After about 30 minutes, we got seated. I ordered \"The Our Burger\". It had lettuce, tomato, onion, their signature wall sauce, and pickles. There wasn't too much sauce on my burger, which I appreciated. The sauce was flavorful and added a nice touch to the burger. I also ordered the Yukon gold fries, which were good. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a bar area with several flat screen TVs and seating both inside and outside. The service was poor. It must have taken over 40 minutes to receive our food from the time we ordered. Once we finished, it took awhile to receive our checks. I do not think they were appropriately staffed with the amount of customers in the restaurant. There was a concert going on at the stadium nearby, so I don't think they were quite ready. The burger market is saturated, and although the wall sauce was good, it wasn't enough to really differentiate themselves from the other burger chains. There's only so many different ways you can make a burger.\n",

      "My husband chose Wahlburgers as his birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us.  We were a little nervous because there was an Indians game and a Cleveland and a concert at the Q - but our wait was only about 20 minutes. After we were seated, we ordered 4 waters WITH LEMON and a bourbon beer and sweet potato tater tots to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tater tots were absolutely delicious.  Waitress forgot the lemons, and they ran out of the beer we wanted.  They also \"ran out of cups, but got the plastic ones ones our water was served in from \"somewhere\" - a little sketchy\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, on to food, we had 3 burgers, they were good, not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.  A portabella mushroom burger, was good.  And a Mom's sloppy joe - which my mom said was good.  So over all the food was good.\n",
      "Also ordered the onion rings (which were really onion straws), but in my opinion were the highlight of the dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few things:\n",
      "* they didn't have lemons (despite being a restaurant and full service bar)\n",
      "* the special Wahl-sauce tasted like ketchup, mayo and water\n",
      "* the BBQ sauce tasted just like the Wahl-sauce\n",
      "* they \"ran out of cups\"\n",
      "* I don't understand the wire baskets instead of plates, plastic silverware and paper cups format - I wish it wa\n",
      "* the waitress had \"no clue\" what the feature burger was\n",
      "* the check in process was a pad of paper, which the host wrote our name and phone number - took forever \n",
      "* despite being seated within 20 minutes, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to greet us, and then about 30 minutes for the food to come to the table \n",
      "* everything was ala carte - so the $9 burger, plus $3.50 side was pretty expensive for \"average\"  especially if you want a \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I think it was good - and hopefully because it's new they are going through growing pains, and once they get their ordering system up and running, as well as fully trained staff (our waitress was not knowledgeable of anything and kept using the phrase \"I have no clue\") things will get better!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pretty good burger, but I'm not a burger connoisseur. The tots and onion rings were good. I'd like to go back and try the fries. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is just a burger joint. Don't expect a huge menu with a lot of options, especially vegetarian.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had to try this place because of Mark Wahlberg and the TV show but the food was nothing special. Average burger and fries. Cleveland definitely has better burgers. Townhall or Flipside or Harry Buffalo come to mind\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Fine I guess.  Nothing special at all. I hope it goes out of biz and is replaced with a shake shack. Service was fine but maybe weird. Burger was slop on a bun.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "There was a lot of hype surrounding Wahlburgers and I was excited to try their food. I felt the burger was average. Their special sauce on the burger was nice, but it didn't really set it apart from any other burger place. I didn't care for the fries, but that is just my personal preference as my husband loved the fries. I like slimmer more crispy fries, but I will say the food was fresh and brought out hot. I would visit again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. The service was good and our food came out quickly during lunch time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was excellent, customer service however was not. Our waitress of the name Jenny was not charismatic and got both our burgers wrong. Didn't seem interested in us at all. For such a family oriented establishment this seemed surprising to me. You can get better service at Chipotle tbh. Prior to dining in, we had to call because we missed the sign and wanted to make sure we were in the right place, and the person on the phone had an attitude when I asked saying that it's obviously the restaurant with Wahlburgers on the front, great food, sucky service.\n",

      "We ended up there before an Browns game and it ended up being packed. End of August the weather was still a bit warm, inside was nice and air conditioned but we ended up sitting in the back outside of the bar. BIG mistake. I thought i was gonna die of overheating. Not sure why they had an outside bar area and didnt think to put some fans out there for circulation jesus. Even the poor bartender was sweating bullets, her shirt literally soaked. She was nice through it all though, however, the way the bar is situated it had seats on the end near where the other waiters\\/waitresses do the checks and you can overhear the horrid conversations some of the staff have. For example, on this particular day, they were getting packed and this waitress with blonde hair and some tatts was blatantly saying \" i wish these f*king people would leave my table i cant deal with them anymore\" and then she started talking about her fellow employees to another employee and they were very rude and open about it. The manager needs to address her ASAP.\n",

      "The burger, i ended up getting a fiesta burger medium well and some onion rings.\n",
      "The burger was a little on the rare side for me, i purposely asked for medium well but they fell short on the mark. The burger was decent, a bit sloppy for me, the bun got soggy from the salsa, the cheese wasnt fully melted it was kind of a slop. The onion rings were the highlight, a single order is enough to feed two, and it comes with this awesome dipping sauce. We were engaged with some hand crafted beer from local brewerys which was awesome because now i have a new beer to guzzle lol. The waitress again was nothing short of awesome, despite her burning behind the bar she maintained a smile and did her job perfect.\n",

      "A couple of things for the owners\\/manager:\n",
      "\n",
      "If your staff isnt happy theres a quick fix, find new staff. Get fans for the outdoor bar area because newsflash if they are sitting outside its most likely summertime. Teach your cooks the difference between rare and cooked because thats a health code violation waiting to happen and PLEASE consider your seating arrangements. it was a bit tight in the actual inside dining area, almost impossible to pass people.\n"

      "I was very happy when Cleveland finally got a Wahlburgers so I had high hopes going in.  My father and sister had just went here a couple weeks prior to my visit and had a wonderful visit and my Dad said his burger was the best he's ever had. We went on a Saturday early evening and we were seated right away. Our waiter Dwayne was the best part of our whole experience. He was very nice, fun, efficient and went above what most waiters do. Three of us ordered well done burgers and specifically asked that we did not want any pink whatsoever. When our burgers came out 2 of them were not only pink but had blood coming out. Our waiter was very upset by them also having one of the burgers wrongly ordered by having lettuce on it when asked without but also because 2\\/3 were pink and bloody. Management wanted to discount the burgers that we didn't even touch instead of taking them off the check completely which was a joke. What food establishment DISCOUNTS food you don't eat that THEY screw up instead of removing it from your check? We asked to speak to management and they sent out their little manager not the head honcho. The worker seemed a bit nervous and scared I'm not sure why but as if he would be in trouble even though it wasn't his fault. They need new chefs working there if they want some more business. Dwayne was an excellent waiter he was personable, kind and very apologetic even though it wasn't his fault but the chefs. Management did end up taking the burgers off the check but that was after us requesting to speak to him. I'm not completely sure I would go back after this experience if I do it would be because the staff made us feel at home not because of the cooking. Get some new cooks in the back who know how to cook up a burger and who can follow some simple directions. Don't let the Wahlburgers name go down in the dumps just because of some crappy chefs.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Burger spot. No just kidding, it's a burger spot. But it is well known. Good thing is there are some good burgers here. The sizes of the burgers are perfect. My wife and I ate at the exterior bar. This is why they are receiving 3 stars. It was hot the day we went and over the bar there aren't any fans. I can't knock whoever built the place, because they may not have known that the area in downtown isn't the most windy. They're on Ontario, prospect is basically the wind tunnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "The interior is bright. The indoor bar is large with plenty of tables to seat plenty of hungry individuals. The wait time when we went was no existent. Around the interior there are plenty of posters, all wahlburg branded of course. Movie posters for Mark, you know. It's right under the jack so you can either enter or exit right from an elevator straight from the jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that out of the way, let's speak on service and food. Our bartender was delightful. She understood the heat and gave us water without us even saying anything. She was thorough and attentive. Walburgers has a simple menu, not too large or small. This is a good thing. The negative is that fries are not a standard side. They make up by having large sides that you purchase separately that can be shared between two people. That's what my wife and I did. We ordered our 2 burgers and split their crispy onion rings, which were a HUGE helping for the price. Speaking on the onion \"rings\" they weren't rings, they were more like crispy shreds. They breading on them was delicious though. I'd never thought I'd like onion shreds outside of a burger but they were definitely done right. This is once again where the bartender came in and helped, we both ordered the onion rings, she quickly told us that we'd definitely only need one serving as it ended up being a large basket. I'd even say 3 people could share them if they get larger burgers. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the burgers themselves. They're definitely flavorful. I ordered the double decker. Which is a classic burger, the veggies were crisp and fresh, the bun was delicious. I haven't seen others reviews or why wahlburgers is getting a bad rap unless it's because of the outdoor bar. The food is good , I've had better burgers elsewhere, but these burgers definitely lived up to the hype.\n",

      "Seated with a larger group right away on a Saturday in a nice spot on their spacious patio. \n",

      "I got the fiesta burger and it was delicious! Only complaint would be all the sauce is laid on the bottom bun, so the burger gets a little soggy and may fall apart. Our table also got onion straws\\/rings to share and they were incredible, gone in probably 5 min. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was excellent for everyone, HOWEVER, can't see myself wanting to go back due to service. Our waiter was awful. Silence when we ordered, never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. That was the most surprising. Wait for our food was pretty lengthy but not crazy. \n",

Maybe come back after they weed out some of the employees. Only nice part on this visit was the outdoor seating. That's why I'm giving this 3 stars.\n",

      "We ordered takeout from here and wasn't disappointed. They were very fast and friendly when we picked it up. My husband ordered sweet basil which could've used quite a bit more basil. I ordered spicy fried rice and it was very good. The prices we reasonable. Our bill was less than $20. This is definitely a family-owned restaurant which I really liked. They had a cute little bar in their with a great selection of Asian beers. Next time I go I will eat in so I can try some!\n",

      "In any case I gave this place a 4\\/5 stars solely because of the Thai food they offered and customer service. Before I started plant based diet, I used to get their BBQ chickens. They were DELICIOUS! Also they have a tasty Thai tea here. It's very sweet though to if you are avoiding sugar it's probably not your thing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great food, good service, a little pricey but will definitely come back. Unlike other Thai joints, they actually check on you & refill your water here which is so nice! The 4 instead of 5 stars is because the waiter kept asking me if I was sure I wanted a spicy dish (I know, I know - I look too white to be able to handle spice but I love it!) and after I convinced him yes, the dish wasn't spicy at all and I HATE when they do that! I appreciate they're trying to protect me but they need to trust me when I order spicy. Food still had great flavor.\n",

      "My wife and I went to Bangkok Thai on a weekday afternoon, the place was quiet and low key. As we walked in, the hostess was very friendly. My wife had the Mighty Masaman Curry, and I had the spicy cat fish recommended by another yelper. Both dishes were delicious. The curry sauce was thick, creamy, coconutty and flavorful it went well with the potatoes and chicken. The cat fish was awesome, I'm not sure what the batter it was fried in was but I loved the fact that it wasn't greasy flavored or textured. The sauce that went with the cat fish was kinda sweet and a bit spicy depending on the level of spiciness you choose. We had coconut ice cream with fried bananas in a wonton as our dessert and those were pretty good too.\n",

      "\n",
      "OK, So since 1-1-2013 I went vegetarian and have been rating the places I like and cater to the vegetarian and vegan who wants good food and a place their meat eating friends can enjoy too. So I was in the mood for some Tom Kha soup and something I hadn't tried before. I ordered the Tom Kha, mild and wished I had gone for the medium...a little too westerned down for one who likes a little bite back. I also got the Buddhist Garden (which they do offer with meat as well or tofu)...very tasty! I am trying to figure out why the place was empty on a Saturday night...I'm figuring it's new and hasn't been discovered yet. But if you live on the west side and want some very good Thai this place delivers....just be prepared to pay $5.99 for that delivery...better to just go and pick it up...worth it too. Would have been 5 stars if the veges had been just a LITTLE LESS COOKED...NOT SOGGY BUT NOT QUITE CRISP AS I LIKE THEM.\n"

      "This Thai Restaurant offers many items that I haven't seen before on Thai Menus. We started with curry puffs. They were crispy won ton skins stuffed with marinated seasoned minced chicken and sweet potatoes. They were tasty but didn't remind me of curry....just tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the chili eggplant with chicken. This dish was delicious! My chicken was tender and the sauce was bright, tasty and accented with lots of fresh herbs. For me it had all the right flavors going on. My husband had the sweet basil with beef. The beef was slightly chewy but the flavor of the sauce was good and this dish was infused with basil flavor like it should be. We both ordered our dishes HOT and they were perfect for us. Real pepper was used for heat and not powder like from some other Thai Restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Portions were good. I thought they were large for Thai.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have sticky rice and brown rice on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many seafood dishes are offered and they have FOUR kinds of fish on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of this review they have these fun complimentary scratch off lottery type of tickets were everyone is a winner and you can get some money off your next order. (We both got $5.00 scratch offs)\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had a taste for Thai and was at the hospital so thought we would drop in. As said before, the place was completely empty so we did not expect much. We were surprised by excellent eggrolls and spring rolls very good Pad Thai and a beef dish with thick noodles and veggies or I don't recall the name. All the food was very savory and flavorful not sure about that earlier comment but ours was very good. We will definitely come back again!\n",
      "Don't let the outside ambiance fool you the food is excellent.\n",

      "It seems they do a very good takeout business as well. Something to keep in mind!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have gone here a few times and the food is consistently delicious.  The service has also been excellent.  All the dishes are good portions and fresh.  One of the most overlooked dishes are the desserts.  OMG!  The sticky rice and coconut ice cream is delish!\n",
      "Like another reviewer, I would have given them the full 5 stars, but they did the same thing to me with the tip.  Without asking she took the entire $6 as tip!!!  When she said \"thank you, Good Night,\" I realized that I wasn't getting any change.  \n",
      "Other than that, I recommend it.  Just tell them you want your change.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great place to eat! The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. While the restaurant may look a little rough on the outside, it's very clean and neat on the inside. Highly reccommend!!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I want here on a first date and the food was really good! I enjoyed my meal I got the Pad See Ew and my date really enjoyed his meal, it was some type of chicken curry dish. When we got there there was no one else in the restaurant, but the restaurant is decorated well and it has a very inviting environment. The service was good too, example; we never ran out of beverages (pet peeve of mine). On the subject of drinks, I really liked what ever brand\\/type of iced tea they service. Delicious!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "they have a chicken with lemon grass and coconut milk soup that I swear has crack in it because I can't get enough. I think it's the #18 or something. My girlfriend and I have cravings for it. It's so good, refreshing and just awesome. She loves the curry and some other dishes. The staff is friendly. Most of the time it's just us or maybe another couple in the restaurant and try the thai tea\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great service and tasty food!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just ate here for lunch recently and was very impressed.  My girlfriend and I got a take out order, she got Red Curry Chicken and I got the Sweet Basil Chicken Stir Fry.  Both were excellent.  The sauce in my stir fry had just the right amount of spice and both the vegetables and chicken were cooked very well.  She was also a big fan of her curry.  We will definitely be coming back in the future, I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Got the lunch special mango delight and red curry. Both were delicious. I especially loved the mango delight. I ordered online through yelp and linked my card for 10%cash back. It was easy and my food was waiting and paid for when I walked in! I will definitely do this again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just had an order delivered to my job.  My co-worker and I were both happy that everything was prepared fresh and came hot!  They included everything we needed.  The only con is that there is a delivery fee AND a service fee totalling almost $10!  I'm assuming that included the driver's tip.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great tasting thai and really cheap! The place isn't busy most of the time so it's easy to get seated anytime. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the Pineapple and shrimp curry, spicy with the perfect amount of tang to balance it. The serving size is generous as well, easily enough for take home.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's tucked away in the far end of the building but is quite an enjoyable place to eat. I had the BBQ chicken that was excellent. The curry is quite good. The dessert was definitely my favorite with the banana medallions. So delicious and quick friendly service. I love Thai food and this place hits the spot.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thai menu is exactly what you would think to find for a great Thai cafe with some surprises. The soups were our particular favorites. The mainstay of every visit. Service can be disconnected from what you think you need but it could be a communication issue.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went to Bangkok and loved the papaya salad. It came out crisp and with just enough heat. their lunch fresh rolls and soup are a great free addition to their lunch menu. It was good because we petty much ate as soon as we sat down(perfect to get fed ASAP on a short lunch hour).  It looked pretty slow when we came in\\ but then again they likely just opened around 11 on a monday.Very reasonable lunch prices and dinner didn't look that much more. I have to come back on a weekend for dinner.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love this place it's so good. I asked for Thai spicy and it is blow your mind hot. So good I don't know why it's not extremely busy it should be!!! :) happy holidaze\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The pineapple chicken curry was pretty good at a reasonable price.  I was disappointed that all of the other curries incorporate the exact same vegetables (including a poisonous plant called \"zucchini\"), but the pineapple curry uses a different mix.  The vegetables DID seem like they had been frozen, and there were no fresh herbs, so that's why I didn't give them the fifth star.  The punctuality, price, quantity and quality of meat, and overall flavor were quite favorable.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I always order Thai food EXTRA MILD, and they actually got this one right.  Plenty of flavor, but no pain :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. The lunch prices are very affordable! I got the Panang Curry and he got the Pad Thai. \n",
      "\n",
      "The lunch comes with a spring roll and cup of soup. The soup was ok but the spring roll was fresh and delicious. My Panang curry was amazing! I got it very mild and it still had a slight spice which is exactly how I like it. The Pad Thai seemed a little bland to me but my fiancé preferred it to others that he has had that had a little more sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is off the beaten path and tucked away in a complex but if you like Thai food I would recommend seeking it out and giving this place a try!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Locate on the NW corner of 51st Ave and Thunderbird, you won't see this hidden gem, in an unassuming looking plaza, from the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you walk in, you'll like the simple yet stylish atmosphere (in comparison to similar food places).\n",
      "\n",
      "The food I have tried is excellent.  The yellow curry comes as hot as you like, and it comes at lunch with small, but tasty soap an egg roll.\n",

      "I try to come back to this place at least every two weeks, despite having to drive 40 streets through local traffic.  It's worth it to me.\n",

      "I go here for lunch often. \n",
      "Quick service and good food.\n",
      "The spicy fried rice and the spicy noodle are my favorites.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A must for all Glendale natives. My good friend frequented this establishment with her family, and after being friends for some 5 to 6 odd years finally shared this little gem with me. I navigated here with her and 4 mutual friends, whom after a long day in the pool, needed some sustenance. \n",
      "The waitress was super friendly, it probably helped that 3 of my friends had recently visited Thailand and had plenty to talk with her about. \n",
      "We had the place all to ourselves. Very cozy. Excited to share our meal \"family style\" we ordered some wonton soup and the fisherman's platter, thai iced teas, and the coconut pineapple fried rice-A MUST. In addition we ordered sweet and sour pork, pad thai- which is the best I've ever had, and a beef dish, blanking on the exact name.\n",
      "We devoured everything, I'm sure the employees were waiting for us to lick the plates. \n",
      "I have not one complaint about this place and look forward to going back for more!\n"

      "Cheap and authentic tasting. Fresh meat and veggies. I like the feeling in the place with the elderly woman cooking in the back that seems to come out to see if we enjoyed our food. Don't ever order anything EXTRA SPICY unless you are looking for a cleansing effect.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has incredible Thai food!!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I dock this place a star is because when I stopped to pickup my take out the lady kept my change as her \"TIP\", ALL $9 OF IT!!!!!!. Who does that !?!? Yes I should of asked for it back, but the balls on this woman I figure she must really need it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway the food is a must on flavor. The green curry is some of the best I have ever tasted. The Tom Kah was a tad greasy but so delish, and the pad thai was actually light and pleasant compared to most places where it is super over whelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will return to Bangkok Thai Bar-B-Q time and time again for delicious what Thai is supposed to taste like food. I am super duper impressed.\n",

      "Stopped in here for a date night last Friday night and was fairly happy with the result.  I ordered the spicy fried rice with beef which I asked for \"hot\". My wife ordered spicy noodle dish which she ordered \"medium\".  Both dishes tasted excellent and the spicy element was perfect for both of our dishes.  The portions sizes were fairly size able for the price of the entrees (~10 each) and I had enough for leftovers which is pretty rare for me especially since it was a late dinner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The one complaint I had was with the dessert. My wife loves sticky rice, especially when the mango is in season.  After we had returned our menus we decided to get the sticky rice without looking at the price when our server told my wife they did have mango available.  The dessert itself was not bad but I was taken aback when I saw the price being about 8 dollars.  Based on the portion size this was at best worth 5 and I felt lampooned but since I didn't check the price I just paid for the meal and hope I learned my lesson for next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ordered take out for my husband and I. We ordered yellow curry, spice, and pad see wu (in not sure how you spell it). We've been going to another place off of bell and this place is a whole lot better. We're officially switching thai restaurants. The only thing is we like our food a little spicier so next to me we will ask. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband said the restaurant looks clean inside although on the outside the building is run down which has nothing to do with the restaurant.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our 4th visit. Food was as good as ever. For the quality of food it is surprising to find not too many patrons. We don't mind the quiet though.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I really liked this place! It was empty when we went it, but most Thai places are around 8:00 pm. The server was really nice and gave good service. We got the spicy basil dish and the sweet and sour chicken. The spicy basil was amazing!!! You could actually taste the basil! It was delicious! On the downside, we got it at \"medium\" spicy level and it was just way too spicy. The sweet and sour chicken was ok. It could have been better. It wasn't very sweet, it was more sour. So I got a side of the sweet sauce and that made it better. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is close by asu so that's a plus too. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really enjoyed their food and service.  It was late and we did takeout on a Monday night.  Surprising how many Thai restraunts are not open on Monday night.   The Red and Green Curries were delicious as was the Spicy noodles and Phad Thai.  Egg plant with chicken and basil beef also wonderful.  I was also surprised that there were not more people eating inside.  It's clean and the service was excellent.  I asked for peanut sauce and some extra hot spices to go  They mixed up the peanut sauce fresh at no charge.  Very accommodating.  I really liked the young couple that helped us.  If you like Thai better support this restaurant. Really enjoyed their food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We just got take out from Bangkok Thai and it was great.  The medium was plenty spicy, and we definitely like heat.  We got the red curry and the cat fish, both were excellent.  We'll certainly put this place into a regular rotation for takeout night.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decided to try this place on a date night with the fiancee. At work we order from Thai House on Shea in Scottsdale which is always good food,. I was in the mood for Thai and live in Peoria so this place was fairly close. \n",
      "The restaurant was empty except for one other table of 4 people, which is great for me because I don't like crowded noisy restaurants.\n",
      "The place was clean. We were greated and seated right away.\n",
      "We ordered Thai tea YUM! \n",
      "We ordered the spicy Shrimp soup for an appetizer. Then we waited. 10 -15 minutes later our soup was brought out. I liked it - but it was chicken not shrimp (that's one of the reasons I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars). Apparently the fiancee wasn't reading when I asked him if he wanted to try that soup, it has mushrooms and he hates mushrooms, but he said he wanted to try it. I thought it had good flavor. Watch out for the hard crunchy things (I think it was pieces of ginger) as they have a bite to them and are bitter.\n",
      "The waitress came to ask how our soup was and immediately appologized for the mistake of chicken instead of shrimp.\n",
      "She even had the cook make a small bowl of the shrimp soup for us.\n",
      "Our entress were brought out about 10 - 15 minutes later. I had the shrimp and pineapple curry. Yum! (not as good as Thai House but a close comparison, I'll ask for it to be a little spicer next time as I asked for mild).\n",
      "The fiancee order the cashew chicken YUM! the sauce was very good, not too salty. Lots of good sized cashews.\n",
      "We ordered fried rice to serve it over.\n",
      "Everything was very delicious.\n",
      "When we were almost finished the waitress came out with a bowl of coconut ice cream with chocolate drizzle. VERY YUM!! She said she was very sorry for the mix up with the soup and wanted us to try the ice cream. She said it is homemade with organic coconut milk.\n",
      "VERY nice gesture. \n",
      "Excellent customer service (other restaurants could learn a thing or two from them)\n",
      "will be back when the Thai craving hits again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is pretty good! I've been here 4 or 5 times now at both lunch and dinner times. I'm not sure why there's never anyone else in here though. Maybe it's more of a pick up place. The servers are so sweet. Lunch specials are $6.99 and include soup and a fresh roll. Tons of vegetarian options - they do their tofu really well. I recommend the cashew nut with tofu. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm still trying to figure out their spice levels. Once I ordered spice level 5 and couldn't even eat the dish. During lunch they don't even ask your spice level preference and it comes with no spice at all.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ordered take out from here one evening when we didn't feel like cooking. As others have mentioned, don't let the outside stop you from trying this place. It's a generic looking strip mall, but inside this place is quite nice. We ordered online, using EatStreet (I believe), and when we arrived to pick up our order a very friendly woman helped us at the counter and our food was hot and ready to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters we had Chicken Satay and Crab Rangoons. The Crab Rangoons were what I expect, no complaints there. The Chicken Satay was really tasty - cooked properly and well seasoned; served with a nice peanut satay sauce (it's odd how this sauce differs from Thai restaurant to Thai restaurant, and Bangkok Thai's is a pretty good one).\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, my wife ordered The Queen's Fried Rice and I had the Spicy Noodle with chicken. The Queen's fried rice is filled with generous portions of chicken and shrimp and the rice was cooked nicely - soft and of a good consistency. Spicy Noodle is simple but filled with good flavors. Not very spicy in my opinion, but I eat a lot of hot food so I have a bias. I added some chili paste at home and went on happily.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a 4 star experience and we'll certainly be back to try more menu items.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm glad I found this place!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been looking for a thai place to try after our last adventure in dining thai had ended badly and found Bangkok Thai BBQ revitalized my hope for enjoying thai food.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, their Thai Tea is fantastic. Its probably on the sweeter side for most people but I think its amazing. My girlfriend and I crave them constantly and currently this is the only place we know that serves it so well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to their dishes, amazing as well. I tried both the Pineapple Curry with Pork and Sweet Basil with Pork. The Pineapple curry was something I had never tried and would get again and again from now on however, the pineapple slices themselves were not the sweet focal point but rather the tomatoes which I loved. I don't even like tomatoes!\n",
      "The sweet basil I also had with pork and was also very good. I was worried when I ordered it that the basil flavor might be too strong or overpowered but it came out just right, very balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'm coming back for my thai tea and those curry puffs they serve as appetizers. They are unreal and you will fight over them when you are down to the last puff.\n"

      "Maybe 4 stars is a little high, I would probably give three and a half if I could.  I came here for lunch and the plac was totally empty.  It's next to a charter school so there might be some kids outside smoking.  I guess it used to be a Mexican restaurant, and you can kind of tell inside from the mirrored arches.  I had the chicken curry lunch special version.  Comes with soup and a spring roll.  The portion of chicken curry was small, but for a lunch special it's not a bad deal- I think around $6.  The food itself was tasty and the service was good.  My water was always refilled.  The \"atmosphere\" of this place leaves a lot to be desired, but maybe if they get some more customers then they could eventually move to a nicer location.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I really like this place, I have tried several of the items off the menu , and they are all good, service has been very good, my only complaint is how cold it can be in there. One time i went there, I was happy to walk outside and warm up.\n",

I found this place through Yelp and here I was thinking it was on Cactus and I drove all up and down and sideways before pulling into a residential area and finding out its on T-Bird.  Needless to say, I was pissed at Yelp and Google maps for providing me with the wrong information and as of today, it is still showing this place on Cactus.\n",

      "Another great offer is the happy hour Sunday-Thursday, 11am to 7pm.  You can get a bucket of bud, Bud light, Kirin, or Kirin light for $10.  Its 5 beers so 2 bucks a pop is not bad.  \n",

TV screens abound, so to have a view from every seat.  The waitress was very knowledgeable as to the roll descriptions.  The pictures on the back wall, of all the celebrities and sports icons, were fun to peruse. I bet this place is hopping at night, being just south of the Arrowhead baseball compound and training center. \n",

      "I ordered 2 sets of the spicy yellowtail rolls, since that's my thang.  They came up quick, and they looked great... but that was nothing compared to their taste.  Probably one of the most spiciest spicy yellowtail rolls I've ever had.  A single tear of joy rolled off my cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "I offered one to my companion, who asserted that his sushi hymen was indeed intact.  After trying it, he blurted out complements regarding the bite sized treat... so I offered another.  But that's where my hospitality ended.  These were so good, that I bogarted 10 of the 12 rolls.\n",

Service and everything is great until it's time to leave, I push my finished plates to the side and I wait quite a while to get the check then to have the check picked up then to have my card returned (would be a five without the wait at the end) had a crunch roll tonight and I loved it!\n",

All three rolls were delicious this time unlike our last visit. We were extremely happy with our selection of rolls and I can say that I'm still in love with the rock n roll !\n",

      "From now on when I get a yearning for Sushi after a hard days work I am heading here. \n",
      "This week we went with fellow sushi lovers and tried some super Delicious rolls  , loved the Pink Princess Roll ...it really is pink and tasty with pastel sauces laced over the top, also loved the dragon roll , a hot mess of tasty krab -like taste with other  sweet stuff that tasted good and memorable..sorry could not place the ingredients.  Daughter loved her pieces of magura, yellow tail and salmon , they looked clean and fresh.  We also had the Caterpiller , always a favorite. I can't wait to go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was my first time at this particular restaurant and since my friend was relatively unfamiliar with the sushi choices, I picked. I really wish I could remember the names of the things we had. They may come to me before I finish this review (\"Come onnnnnn Red Bull, kick in!). Whenever there's a non-sushi regular, one has to ease them in slowly via the mandatory introductory \"If you're going to actually like anything, it's probably this California Roll\" routine, avoiding squid and things that protrude out at one's face whenever possible. So, the California Roll, like Tennis in that it's easy to get but difficult to master, was actually exquisite! If I remember correctly, the next roll was a Dragon Roll of sorts with eel, cream cheese and some other seafood stuffs locked in there. Again, quite good. The last item was red and and came in an aluminum foil viking ship. It too was quite good. All in all, a nice evening with a good friend, sushi and yes, root beer (for me). I'd go here again for sure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great service and good food ! I ordered a glass of wine witch I didn't like and they gladly changed it for me and then i ordered a roll that I also didn't very like so they changed that for me too ! Thanks for the patience and kind service\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kabuki is never a disappointment.  Not for the half a dozen plus times I've gone there.  The service always comes with a smile.  Though I still consider myself a sushi-novice after a certain number of years, I like the adventure of trying new items on the menu.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am not a huge fan of Sushi but there were 5 of us and the other four (including one from Japan) really enjoyed everything.  We ordered several different Sushi rolls.  My favorite was the Beef Teriyaki and the Shrimp Tempura.  The others raved about the soft shell crab and the calimari.  Several of the rolls fell apart and since I am not experienced with chop sticks, I asked for a fork.  Almost done eating before the fork came but it was a very busy night and the service was fine otherwise.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had a Hawaii roll, with the best tuna! Very pleasantly surprised by our meal. All of our food was top notch. We always look forward to sushi because we don't get it very often... living in Northwest Iowa. We weren't disappointed with this spur of the moment decision.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Seems to be the best Sushi for the price that I have had here in Phoenix.  The restaurant itself is not so special, strip mall special, but the food and service were more than fine.  We had a native Japanese friend with us and she spoke favorably of the items she tried.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It is a standard destination for me when I travel.  Either location, this one is a bit older and nostalgic.  Nice staff.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Delicious! Ordered takeout for dinner last night. We ordered 3 rolls - Phoenix, Crunch and Dynamite. Both the Phoenix and Dynamite were amazing - loved the scallops on top of the Dynamite. The Crunch Roll wasn't as crunchy as I'd hoped, but I think that's because we refrigerated the rolls for a few hours before eating them. The hostess who helped me was very friendly. The cost came to about $40 with tip, which isn't terrible for the quality of the sushi. I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great place!  They didn't take reservations the night we were there, but hinted that if we came early they could seat us.  The wait was about 5 minutes less than what they quoted.  We enjoyed the food and our service, in spite of being seated next to the kitchen\\/door for the wait staff.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good Rainbow roll, rivals my fav at Sakana. Good edamame, not over-cooked. Timed nicely too. one draw back, the service was a bit lack luster, forgot our soy dishes and plates. Oh yeah, comfortable booth seating, not usual in a sushi restaurant.\n",
      "i will go back, hopefully they remember the plates!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "As far as west valley sushi goes, this is one of the best I've had.  Nice display of major league athletic team stuff including a whole wall of photos of the staff with major league players who have visited the restaurant.  Our waitperson was delightful.  The Spicy Poke Salad was the best I've had since I left San Francisco.  We asked for it with tuna only.  I'd make the trip back just for this.  We managed to polish off a Philly Roll, and Tiger Roll and a Rainbow Roll with very little effort, but we waddled out when we left.  I've never had a Rainbow Roll that was totally wrapped in shrimp!!! FANTASTIC.  I would definitely go back; in fact this might be my new favorite sushi place.\n",

      "The only thing I would not recommend here is their White Russian. Ick. Normally they don't come in such tall glasses, and this one is just overkill. Too much of a good thing is never a good thing.\n",

      "Pretty good restaurant. You cannot beat the lunch special here though. Got one and shared it with another person. Alcohol is expensive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Love this place.  Great service.  Very clean.  The Phoenix roll is a must.  They usually have a couple games playing on TV.  My dad has taken his boss here, my grandma had her first sushi here...  in fact, I think I want to go tonight.  Yum.  Oh, I also think it is very affordable.  The fancy rolls are $13.\n",

      "If you haven't had the dynamite roll... you must try it. It is amazing!!!! And they have red snapper shashimi here so delicious. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have tried many of their rolls and if this review was strictly based on the sushi I would give it a 3.5.  The sushi is exactly that.  It is just slightly above average.  The other .5 was added due to the service.  I have never received bad service here.  They are always fairly prompt and adequately friendly.  Decent sushi and good service.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They have a very good selection of Sushi, and other items for you lovers of cooked food. They have a good bar menu and the service is fast and friendly. The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is clean.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went with 2 friends, and we decided to order a couple of the sushi rolls...we went with the Alaska Roll, the Vegas Roll, the Hawaii Roll, the Lobster Roll and some salmon nagiri.  Everything was amazing!  We had fun mixing and matching.  My only issue was, the Lobster Roll didn't have any mention of a Dynamite Sauce on it in the menu, so I wasn't able to eat it (the reason for not giving 5 stars)...I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy things.  But, my friends enjoyed it.\n",
      "\n",

Great waitress, we got seated at the bar but she was very attentive. I love the menu with pictures of all the sushi and appetizers, make ordering so easy. The rolls was delicious and fresh salmon and tuna. Also free Edamame!!! Will definitely come back to try other rolls\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pretty darn good!! Too early to give it 5 stars, but nothing to complain about. Good presentation, appeared relatively clean, no overpowering smells, and friendly looking staff. The staff appeared clean and happy to serve us. Food was not too pricey and was served in a timely fashion. I opted not to try the sushi this day because it's it's very consistent among the better local areas. We had the fire cracker app which was unique and AMAZING!! Definitely a must try if you've never had it! The entrees were awesome too! If the sushi is above par, then I will give it 5 stars.  It all comes down to the presentation and staff because most sushi places are falling behind in one or the other or both. I felt comfortable and important which made the overall experience very positive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has a nice lunch special. You get soup, salad and a three selection combination plate for about $13. I chose the teriyaki beef, combination tempura and California rolls. I couldn't finish my plate. The service was good and the atmosphere was fine for lunch.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My wife and I ate their for our weekly date night before going to see a movie.  Kabuki's happy hour is from 3-6pm, and offers a wide range of appetizers, salads, sushi and rolls to satisfy most people.  I'm definitely not a professional sea-food critic, but I've eaten at at least 6 different sushi places in valley.  Kabuki is one of my favorites thus far...especially for the price.  Vegas roll was awesome, and their Shrimp spring roll was very delicate, and tasted fresh.  The edamame appetizer for free was a nice touch as well.  I'd definitely recommend this place without hesitation.  Oh, and a 12oz draft of Sappporo for less than $2?  Pleasant surprise!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The restaurant is located in a strip mall, but not strip mall quality food at all. The Phoenix and Dynamite rolls were both good. The menu tells you what is both inside and outside the roll so easy to choose menu items if you have dietary restrictions.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "First I am not a sushi expert. I do know when I like something. I have been trying places close to where I live. There are many places close to me in Peoria. Until you start looking you don't realize just how many places there are. This is one place I had not been. So far this is the best place I have tried. Remember this was just the first visit so until I get in several visits and try more of the menu will I really know how much I like them. The star rating could go up or down. The service was great. The meal was about $2.00 more than I have been paying for something similar. It was better tasting. Fresh distinct tastes. I am looking forward to a repeat visit.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great experience. This is a neighborhood \"joint\" that serves good sushi. Loved the crunch roll. Tempura could have been a little bit lighter in texture, but it still quite good. I also recommend the sake bombs, if you don't need to drive.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent Vietnamese restaurant.  They are doing it right.  Service is also top notch.  I typically order the V6 which is vermicelli noodles with shrimp and egg roll plus your choice of pork, beef, or chicken.  I typically can't decide so I get beef and pork.  I had the calamari app this go around and was not a fan.  The platter app is good, 2 spring rolls, 2 egg rolls, and 2 coconut shrimps.  Great value and tons of good flavor.  Definitely a spot I will go back to.\n"

I really like the setting and atmosphere they are going for here. Very quiet and peacful place to just get away and relax. I ordered the combination pho without the tendon. It was really good! I loved the textures of the different meats, and the broth was very very good! I was very please with the pho here. I will definietly be back to get it again.

The bread was a little less crusty than I'm used to, but it was nice not to have it cut the roof of my mouth as I have with Bahn Mi sandwiches in the past. There was a really good amount of tender and flavorful pork on the sandwich and bonus points for NO weird chewy bits or extra fatty parts. My ONLY complaint with the sandwich is that the pickled veg on top was not sour enough, it was almost more like a sweet pickle, which combined with the sweet sauce they put under the pork (delicious by the way) was ALMOST too much sweetness. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Pho itself was really really flavorful. My wife said delightedly that \"it tastes like Christmas\" which was a complement especially since it was her first time ever trying Pho. The Brisket was really tender and full of intense Beef flavor, however next time I'd be interested to try something a little less intense in meaty flavor as I think it covered up some of the delicate flavor in the broth. \n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely loved that they send you home with all the accompaniments in separate containers so that you're able to add things based on your preferences. I ran out of cilantro and onion, but that's just because I like a bunch in my pho. \n",

      "Alright Pho, nothing that stands out.  Service is fine and the place is really clean.  The spring rolls are good and the kids always want an order of egg rolls.  They tried the calamari one time but they were not impressed.  Had the grilled meat and rice plate once.  I always love the Vietnamese grilled meats with the fish sauce.  I just wish the egg was fried with runny yolk.  Other Vietnamese restaurants have the runny yolk so I am spoiled.  When I am lazy and in the mood for Pho, we go here cause it is right down the street.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I usually end up at this restaurant when I am the mood for Vietnamese because it is my neighborhood joint. That said, I solidly believe this is one of best places to get pho and spring rolls. The broth and portion sizes of the beef soup are superior to restaurants in south Chandler.\n",

I have never had a pho with broth that I haven't had to add siracha, chili paste etc. The broth had a strong cinnamon taste and at first it was odd but once I added lime I found that the broth was perfectly balanced and satisfied all of my cravings.

      "Visiting Arizona for the first time. This place was hot and new so thought we'd checked it out. Overall very impressed. The place is super clean! The declarations are tasteful. I know most Viet places can be over the top but this place is spot on. Photographs very well chosen. Having been to Vietnam it brought back some fond memories. We came for lunch. Started with spring rolls which were fresh and delicious. The peanut sauce was phenomenal. Had vermicelli with grilled pork and \"noodle soup\" (hu tieu). Grilled pork was nice but the red pork in my hu tieu was dried. There aren't many options but the ones they have are good. The prices are a little high for Viet foods but I also come from a city where there are lots of Vietnamese places so I suppose when you're one in a few you can charge as much as you want. Our server was pleasant. I didn't catch her name but appreciate that the service gestures are there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "An eclectic, modern atmosphere and fresh, delicious ingredients make this pho experience definitely worth coming back again and again. I had the chicken pho with steamed vegetables added. It was amazing! Large portion sizes means you'll satisfy even the most ferocious appetite, or take it home as the leftovers are just as yummy. \n",

      "As for appetizers, the shrimp rolls were fresh and delicious, and I highly recommend trying one of their shakes. Both the taro and mango shakes were very tasty. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Visiting from Syracuse, NY and have wanted to try this place near my parents' home. Got take-out combination bun (noodle dish with egg roll, shrimp and pork), my go-to Vietnamese dish. Their pork was dry and I didn't end up eating much of it. The rest of the dish was great! I love the fresh veggies - cucumbers, bean sprouts, lettuce, mint. My brother (tofu noodle dish) and mom (shrimp and egg roll noodle dish) also liked theirs. Thai iced tea was yummy and finished quickly! I'd come back!\n",

I waited 20 minutes for it to be made, the restaurant didn't look busy but theres \"Door Dash\" and \"Uber Eats\" now, so who knows, maybe they were busy with to-go\\/delivery orders.  \n",
      "While I was sitting waiting someone came in who used \"door dash\" and he said this was the last time they were getting food there because this was mistake #5. \n",
      "So service is obviously an issue here, but their food is GREAT.  The chicken Pho is so good.  I always get double chicken and it's really good, just bring your expectations down in the service department.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was my first time trying Pho so I really have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was great. I had the flank steak and my wife had the spicy seafood. I liked hers more, but mine was still good. This is a great place for first timers. Service was fast and friendly.  Restaurant was clean and modern. Manager checked in on us to see how everything was. You can tell that it is a well run restaurant and they take pride in what they do. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their menu.\n"

AZ Pho Grill did not disappoint! The base for a good pho is the broth, and their eye of round steak pho broth was probably one of the best broths I've ever had. And I've had A LOT of pho.  The balance ingredients in the bowl was pretty much perfect; not too much, not too little. But man oh man, that broth was good. I would have given five stars, but I can't because all I ate was the pho with a Thai tea. However, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My god, this place is awesome.  As a grocery store, it's clean, has all your Korean needs and quite often there are samples being given out.  It's big, prices for the most part are fair and all prepared food reduces in price after 7:30pm (hot food, sushi, kimbap) yum.  The best part of this place is that it has a cafeteria that will make various Korean dishes for not nearly what they would charge you at a nice Korean restaurant and yet the dishes taste just as good or in some cases, even better.  The pork bone soup for example, this place has given me the tastiest one I have ever had so far and I've had quite a few now.  The make-your-own lunch isn't bad either except you have to be smart about what you want.  For example, me being not so smart I grabbed some macaroni salad, why that?  I have no idea.  This was a crappy macaroni salad and it was heavy so it just added weight to my dish and made it more expensive.... lame.  Luckily it was after 7:30pm so 50% off!!!!!  \n",
      "When buying food from the cafeteria, I highly suggest some of the combos.  One I've gotten before was $12 and I got a single serving of jajangmyun (which is gigantic and overfilled 2 of us) as well as some sweet and sour pork (deep fried and I would say more sweet than sour).  This meal alone will more than fill 2 of you and I've got to say, the jajangmyun is incredible.  My only regret is I wore a white shirt and sauce got on it.... it won't come off :(  The naengmyeon isn't bad either but you might as well just buy the packages and make it yourself..... other than the egg and cucumber and one slice of pork you get with it I'm convinced they are just using the package.  That being said, it's delicious especially on a hot day.\n",
      "Cheap Asian food is a weakness of mine and this place is making me fat.  Is it worth it though?  Absolutely.  Give it a try and if you can wait till after 7:30pm, I would say do it and eat like crazy!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like the fresh seafood better than the young location. Then have uni in the tray when it is in season.  As fresh or fresher than Dianna seafood.  Also the KOREAN  fried chicken is good.  Not as good as the fry (on tinge) but you can order in advance since it takes 30 minutes to prepare .\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What's not to like when you go shopping and you find something for FREE?  Yes, as I was perusing the meat section of this uber clean and nicely organized Korean food store, they had neatly wrapped packages of free  bones.  Bones are trendy and so, more expensive now and greatly appreciated by my dog Sailor (the one with the very large, sharp pointy white teeth.)  I picked up some cool snacks and some great take-out food.  I'll be back.\n",

Yup, definitely had a GOOD \"check-out\" experience here unlike Michelle G.   ;D\n",

On monday, they have $4.99 for one lb of their lunch buffet, I got an arrangement of things like seaweed salad, potato salad, sweet & sour pork, sweet & sour chicken, and the Japchae. I enjoyed the potato salad and japchae most. My boyfriend got the pork bone soup. It was fall off the bone good. It was delicious!

      "I have been a fan of the Galleria Super Market since they opened. The original spot was trend setting IMO for Korean Food focused super market. Alas I moved downtown and my trips have become few and far between to this gem of a  place. Next came their move to a new spot near steele to accommodate surprise surprise a condoplex. The new setup is confusing at best as it was not purpose built (old chapters building).\n",
      "So I had been itching to try out this branch ever since it opened. Finally I madeit  here today and its safe to say I like this spot better than the original flagship just because the layout alone makes a lot more sense. Location is more accessible if you are driving from downtown and there is a lot more to explore in this area as there are plenty of things in the same enclave. \n",
      "In terms of variety I think its about the same as the Thornhill branch. You get your specialized cuts of meat that are geared towards Korean Cuisine. I highly recommend the cuts of Kalbi from here as they sell some of the cuts I have rarely seen in a restaurant (Kalbi King Rib) let alone a grocery store. Then you have your kimchi filled refrigeration area, sauce mixes etc etc.  \n",
      "Plenty of other knick knacks are also there which go well with beer or with mains. \n",

      "I love Galleria Supermarket.  It's like a Korean Loblaws!  I used to go to the one on Yonge and Steeles, but now that they moved to a different location (still at Yonge and Steeles, but a different physical space), it's not that easy to access from the street, so I like this one on York Mills better!  FYI: the York Mills location is not open 24 hours, it closes at midnight.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, this location has a by-the-weight buffet.  The buffet is awesome.  It's $4.99 a pound, and there is a good selection.  Last time I was there they had bulgogi (I think they always have this), a spicy battered chicken (similar to General Tao chicken, but Korean instead of Chinese), chicken wings, meatballs, noodles, rice, tofu and so much more.  The food was delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is very clean and the lighting very bright.  I like this kind of shopping environment!  When I was there, they had lots of \"sampling stations\" where employees were giving samples of items that were on promotion.  Some of the things they were giving out were dumplings, rice cakes, ramen, and kimchi.  All the employees giving out the samples were wearing face shields and gloves.  Some people may think \"science fiction movie,\" but I think \"good sanitation!\"  I value cleanliness, so this scores big points with me.\n",

      "First the good things.  I find this Galleria has a lot more selection than the one at Yonge and Steeles.  There were products here that I don't see at that location.  It feels like this location is also larger and able to carry more items.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The parking here is also tremendously better than the other location.  They have a humongous parking lot in the back of the plaza it is located in.  You don't think there would be this many spots looking in from the street.  This is great because this location shares the plaza with a lot of other places so you do need parking to be ample.  \n",

      "Now, the things I don't like as much.  The food court was a little disappointing to me unfortunately.  The other location has 4 different stalls to choose from.  Each stall has different types of cuisine.  This place only has the one stall, albeit a really big one.  The seating is also not as good.  There are bar like seats situated around the stall which is great if you're eating alone.  If you come as a family, you have about 10-15 tables to choose from at that's it. I came for mama's chicken and quite frankly, you can do better for Korean fried chicken.  It's good, but didn't match the hype.  Home of Hot Taste blows it out of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, this location is not open 24 hours.  I have stated the convenience of having a supermarket available at all times during the day.  Most of the Korean supermarkets I find are open 24 hours so it's strange not to see this one as well.  I'm thinking it's about the location more than anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "To finish, you can't go wrong with either Galleria.  I myself just prefer one over the other.  You will have your opinion as well.  We can both agree though that Galleria rocks!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Supermarket: a nicer, cleaner version of all those Asian supermarkets. Kind of like T&T but for Korean products more than anything else. A little pricier than sketchy Asian supermarkets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food court: pork bone soup is super tasty and comes with rice (one of the best). The  noodles in black sauce (can't write the name in English) are disappointing here because the noodles taste like spaghetti and not the traditional noodles. The sweet and sour pork type dish is delicious and fresh and the soft tofu in spicy soup is delicious, but has more of a seafood profile than other ones I've had. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food is fast, fresh  and hot, but seating is scarce at peak-ish meal times.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "30% off the \"per lbs\" hot food section (i.e. where you make you own plate) starts at 7:30pm, however, the whole section closes at 8pm.\n",

      "The cafeteria also closes at 8pm. That means no more ordering of Mom's Chicken and all other \"a la carte\" hot food orders. \n",

      "Coming from Orlando, a place deprived of Korean food options, my (Korean) wife and I were like kids in a candy store at this food court. It was so good that we had to come back the next day to try other dishes. Almost everything (see pictures) we had was very tasty considering that it is a food court. My favorite was the pork bone soup, The only let down was the naengmyun, which seemed subpar. We also introduced this place to our uncle, and now he stops by regularly to eat.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Galleria is a large Korean supermarket that sells mostly Korean and Japanese groceries. It also houses a cafeteria, bakery, health product counter, and some boutiques. It's a great place to go for one-stop shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cafeteria is a bit hit and miss. Some good menu items like the pork bone soup (flavorful and tender pork), and then some outright terrible ones like the Korean traditional noodles (bland noodles in a bland kimchi broth). Service is generally good, though brusque at times. Solid experience, all in all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wi-Fi is also hit and miss, but hey, it's free!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great Korean supermarket that we happened to discover by way of chance. The selection of all Asian type food is outstanding. However the real deal with this place is the restaurant and all the prepared foods. It is out of this world amazing. Selection is huge and food looks and tastes fresh. Everything is available from your Korean fried chicken to noodles, different Korean dishes and also of course sushi\\/sashimi. I did notice some of the grocery items a bit more expensive than other Asian marts I've been to but prices are only a tad higher. If I lived nearby with the busy lifestyle I have I'd frequent Galleria weekly. Asian food is comfort food for me and it's plentiful and delicious looking. Yeah folks come try some out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "As a Korean living in the area, I feel my Yelp account would not be complete without a review of Galleria Supermarket. From the moment it was rumored Galleria Supermarket would be coming to my hood, I was counting down the days. I kid you not, I even got \"insider updates\" through friends and family, on how soon it would be opening, and how big it was going to be. Unfortunately I had to work on opening day so I wasn't able to witness history in the making, but I did go the next day, and the next, and the next. In fact, i just came back from Galleria right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "The supermarket itself is very well organized, bright, well maintained and always clean. The service is also very great, lots of friendly ahjumas, ajusshis and Korean college students to help the lost ones. Koreans are generally always in a rush so the service is always quick as well.  The food is very clean and so are the products. Their banchans are good though not as good as some of the ones from the smaller stores down at Bloor & Christie (Korean Town).  Oh and the Bakery is also quite the improvement form the old location in terms of taste and selection. The Sweet Potato Bun, the Peanut Cream Bun, the Custard Bun, all yummy, even the cakes and the rolls taste better. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have AMAZING fried chicken smothered in sweet and spicy sauce, which is worth a try. In fact I'm craving it right now... They also have a really great Lunch and Dinner Buffet, and the prices are extremely reasonable, even if its NOT all you can eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 8 or 9PM, many of their baked goods, and other ready-to-eat food items go on sale for 15-50% off... which is super awesome because\n",
      "\n",
      "A) It's cheap...!!! Buy moreee!! \n",
      "B) It assures me that they only sell fresh items :)\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside:\n",
      "Considering the big location, they don't have as much selection as one might expect. I know, it sounds crazy, but unless you're a pro Korean grocery shopper, that goes in knowing exactly what you're looking for, you wouldn't notice. That said, when it comes to Korean tea, drinks and snacks, I know my stuff. The relatively tiny Hmart down in the North York Area carries more variety when it comes to snacks, probably due to the large population of Korean exchange students in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Galleria Supermarket, I would really like to give you 5 stars but until you up your game with more product variety, I can only give you 4 :(\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like coming here for its large selection. It is my go to place for asian products whenever I am in the area. They have other shops inside the supermarket selling cosmetics etc\n",
      "\n",
      "I like trying new items at the hot foods section whenever I am at the supermarket. There are many prepared foods available to buy. They also have a counter for you to buy quick meals. The prices are reasonable.\n"

      "\n",
      "There is a fairly large hot\\/cold food station in here.  The 'cafeteria' has several options that you pay by weight ($5.99\\/lb).  There's shrimp, glass noodles, spicy fish, veggies, kimchee, different meat options...you get the food picture.  And it's pretty decent food!\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a large counter you can sit and eat at, plus they have tables at the side if you want to dine in.  You can also order a hot meal from the menu - soups\\/noodle dishes\\/rice dishes etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the counter they keep their cold food (perfect for lunches at work) Dumplings, meals to go kinda deals.  The prices are pretty reasonable as well.  \n",

      "If you need to find a particular Asian ingredient check here first - pretty good variety and the prices are right.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "You can also get fairly decent Korean food by the pound at the \"cafeteria\" like buffet at Galleria Supermarket.  For $7 including taxes, you'll stuff yourself silly.  Pretty decent selection too.  The glass noodles and beef are a usual standard here.  There's also regular offering of sweet sour pork \\/ chicken.  Love the veg offerings as its the potpourri of side dishes you'd get when you order BiBimBap at a restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have a hot food selection and you can get fresh hand made dumplings, or korean noodles\\/pork bone soup.  They've recently expanded their menu.   \n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly they make fresh Korean Fish Cakes.  These little bad boys have NOTHING to do with fish other than being shaped into one.  It's like a crispy waffle with red bean paste on the inside and it's a dessert.  Mind you.. it's Asian dessert so don't go expecting chocolate or something, but they're one of my new favourite things.\n",

      "\n",
      "There's also the option of ordering your ready to be made Korean or Chinese-Korean dishes like bibimbap, soon tofu, noodle in black bean sauce at the cash register. They give u this device that vibrates and flashes whenever your order is ready. \n",
      "Did I tell u they also have fresh sashimi and sushi to go?  So far I've tried the bone marrow soup, soon tofu, sashimi salad and create my own lunch box - everything tasted delicious! The best part? Averaging only about 7 dollars each meal! \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget to stop by the waffle station to pick up the some amazing Japanese Korean waffle fish! They were crunchy and piping hot - I haven't been able to leave without picking at least a box of 4 each time. I will definitely be back for my Korean fix on our annual Toronto visit.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mom's Fried Chicken - among the very best in T.O. Regardless of if you prefer it spicy Korean style or just crunchy double-fried, this bird annihilates the Colonel and beats Popeyes and Rally's too. Right up there with Stockyards for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love it's simplicity, with a tiny bit of heat in it's plain iteration, and spicy sloppy deliciousness in the saucy Korean style.  Since I like it both ways, I order mine \"Half & Half\" which is exactly as it sounds. I also really like the smaller pieces, with a whole chicken being about a dozen individual pieces, since that raises the crunchy batter-to-chicken ration, which is all good by me!\n",
      "\n",
      "This place can get busy, and chicken can take 15 - 25 minutes since it is cooked to order, so feel free to call ahead for pickup and then either take it out, or eat-in at one of the tables in house. They also have a hot table selection of decent Korean food which is available for you to build your own container and pay by the pound.\n",

      "\n",
      "While some of the groceries are a little more expensive than your average grocery store, I don't come here for groceries. Galleria offers so many options when it comes to prepared foods. From fried chicken, to bulgogi, to gamjatang, to sushi, to buns, you can try something different every time you stop by. There's also a food court that offers a wide variety of Korean food if nothing in the actual supermarket tickles your fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything that I've tried here is really good. The red bean stuffed fish cakes are really good, so make sure you try those when you're there. For $1.25 each, it can't be beat. \n",

      "So this place is super packed, especially around dinner time. The fried chicken is great, but I wish they'd let you choose between light and dark meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a certain time (7:30 maybe?) all the ready made food becomes half price, which means I got some big tubs of soon tofu for a couple of bucks each. Grab them fast, though. Everyone else knows the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This grocery store has nearly everything you want if you are making Korean food. They also have a pretty good housewares section (too good, says my wallet). It's clean and the prices are quite good. If this place was on my way home from work, I'd likely hit it every single day.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's hard to imagine that food court food could taste very good but at this one supermarket in North York, they certainly defied the odds and presented some of the best foods one could imagine coming out of a food court. Galleria Supermarket is located in the east end of North York and predominately sells and produces some of the most popular Korean products and foods.  I have eaten at the food court numerous times and each time I would order something different.  On a very recent occasion, I went over there for lunch and tried out their Pork Neck Bone Stew with Noodles.  ($7.49)\n",
      "\n",
      "Made freshly on the spot, about five large pieces of pork neck bones with meat on them were mixed with a large piece of potato, glass noodles, vegetables, green onions and what seemed like chili seeds.  All of this was cooked in a hot, spicy broth which I would say had quite the kick to it.  Even though the picture didn't do it a whole lot of justice, there was quite a lot of food in this one bowl.  The combo also came with a bowl of spicy turnips and a bowl of rice.  For the price one paid, one was certainly getting their money's worth. The pork meat was delicious although mind you there was obvious more bone than meat.  On a scale of one to ten, I would put the spicy level at a 6 for this bowl.  It had a pretty good kick to it but I was still able to stomach it pretty good. There were also about two wads of glass noodles on the bottom of the bowl just to give you an idea as to how much food was in this one bowl.  All of it was presented in a very hot ceramic black bowl which kept the food sizzling when it came out of the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a great lunch meal to have.  One bowl of rice and half a bowl of glass noodles really filled one up and when I was done, I left there super satisfied and very happy with my purchase.  If one does not like noodles, they also have a 50-item display where people can pick and choose a mixture of items from that display.  They also have pre-made sushi and there is also a bakery there.  Certainly lots to choose from and all made to taste just like it was from Korea.  If you have not been there before, certainly give it a try.  It sure is quite different than some of the other supermarket food courts in terms of selection and variety.\n"

I could not resist to check out what the pretty Cashier (yes she was there and she was really nice but not my type!) and the kick ass Spicy Seafood Soup (yes it is spicy, made my tummy nice and warm spicy!) and the Corn Silk drink is nice and refreshing to balanced out the spiciness! Damn I drank the soup too! \n",

I also love the system of ordering your food then they give you a pager so that you can continue your grocery shopping while they cook your order.  Very impressed with the cleanliness and efficiency.  I wouldn't say that the food is amazing but compared to any other grocery food court is up there in quality.

They also have one of the freshest sashimi sold at 20% off if you go after 8pm. I usually come here only for the quick eats because their regular grocery items are pretty pricey.

      "Now for the picky white guys opinion which probably doesn't count for too much considering this place caters to the Korean pallet. I prefer the Kimchi at the supermarket downtown. I find the kimchi at Galleria to be too hot\\/spicy. Second the supermarket downtown in Christie carries a larger variety of Energy Drinks (also my favorite one from Japan) and Japanese snacks so I like to visit there. I only comment on this as me and my fiancee lived in Tokyo for 7 years so it is nice to be able to pick up a few of our favorite Japanese items while grabbing \"her\" Korean essentials. Yes that's right I said it, I did it, \"her\" Korean essentials. Just wish the Japanese stuff wasn't so overpriced!\n",

Forever I've been trying to catch some at Diana's Seafood (pun intended) with no luck. I am going straight home and boiling rice to eat it with. This place is bulgogi and kalbi meat heaven, but I wish I found some pre-marinated. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and service was very friendly as well!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has the most selection of Korean products! Their produce is a bit expensive.  They're pre-made bentos and sushi are great and especially affordable when they go on sale in the evening!  Sometimes you can catch the guy at the corner making fresh taiyaki red bean cake.  They also have a food court with menu prices similar to sit in restaurants so I rather do that.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I come here pretty often with my mom to eat and buy some groceries. We like to buy the apples, sweet potatoes (huge bag, usually on sale), ginger (fresher than Chinese supermarkets), Korean cold noodles + soup (from frozen aisle), lettuce (for kimchi) and so on. The items are usually really fresh, some can be quite pricey so it depends on what you buy here. They have a lot of things not limited to food such as kitchenware, slippers, hair dye, skincare, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to the food section, there is a a food court area and bakery inside. They sometimes have the pork bone soup as their daily special for a good deal. The pork bone soup here is good. The meat is very tender! Although it tends to be on the saltier end. You order the food and receive an electronic device that beeps when your food is ready and you go pick it up. They also have prepackaged meals like kimbap, sushi, bentos, and such. Or they have self-serve dishes that they charge by weight. There is also a fried chicken area specifically for ordering Korean fried chicken. I usually get the bibimbap, you can choose between the hot stone or regular (basically cold but you get a bowl of warm rice). Hot stone is like a two difference or something. They recently changed up the side dishes so that it is self-serve, you have the kimchi radish and bean sprouts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the bakery, I am a huge fan of cream. They sell different types of cream bread here so yes I am in heaven haha. I am a matcha fan so I like the matcha one, particularly the one with a layer of cake in it. It is a bit more on the pricey end depending on what type you get but it is a nice treat. They also sell cakes and bingsoo which I haven't tried. And lastly near the checkout of galleria, there is an area that sells taiyaki. I've tried it before and it is so good when freshly made ahh. Buttery goodness haha. Oh and they sell walnut cakes here (cake shaped like a walnut with walnut and red bean filling, pretty good).\n",

They have like a 10% discount for workers on Wednesdays which is good if you work nearby. They have a such a huge variety of meals to choose from after all. Or of you want a quick cheap meal just get the regular kimbap for $3.99!\n"

      "This is a Korean supermarket that I frequent often since I live in the area. I typically go to just pick up their cooked foods and sushi when I am too lazy to cook. The sushi is fresh and there is variety. They got sashimi, sushi and maki combos that are at discount after 7PM. The cooked foods include gimbap, fried chicken, kimchi fried rice, steamed and fried pork vegetable dumplings, mungbean pancakes, Korean soups - the list continues. You'll have to go and see what is available that day. Definitely check out this grocery store whenever you're in the area! Oh and they got a points card. Make sure to subscribe!\n",

I specifically go here to pick up Ontario-grown shiitake and enoki. If you get hungry while shopping, no probs you can grab some food from their cooking station and eat it in their food court. I'm liking their kampppongi and KFC so far... will try more on my next visit.\n",

Prices are reasonable, especially those store-made food, much cheaper than some Korean restaurants but really delicious. It also provides some public seats for little restaurants inside the market to make customers dinning conveniently.\n",

In particular, try out their fresh Sashimi and Sushi prepared foods. If you go after 7 pm, it is marked down 30-40% everyday. You can also go to their food court area and pick up precooked food options such as Bulgogi, Korean Glass Noodles, Kimchi etc. \n",

      "\n",
      "The meat was delicious and while the broth was hearty as well it wasn't as spicy as I tend to like but this was likely personal preference for me, I think. Overall the dish totally delivered... and may I remind you, this was in a GROCERY Store no less!\n",

This included 1\\/2 an Original Fried Chicken (Mom's Chicken), a Korean Style Noodle with Black Bean Sauce (Jajangmyun), and a Stir Fried Rice and Vegetables (aka vegetable fried rice) with black bean sauce). \n",
      "\n",
      "For a combo for 2, it was a lot of food. My parents I shared it and had leftovers to take home (my dad was headed to play badminton, so he didn't fill up. Had he, this combo for 2 would have been the perfect amount of food for the three of us). The rice and the noodles were both fresh. We sat at the bar surrounding their food prep station and watched them make our dinner! I love doing that. The chicken could have been fresh (they do it to order), but we were in a rush, and asked if we could just get a 1\\/2 chicken order from their grab-and-go station, and they were willing to let us do that. I greatly appreciated that, especially as the cashier had to run around for a bit to make sure that it was okay. Even after we got our food, service was very friendly. We asked for bowls and takeout containers and were given them with a smile even though the meal prep people were very busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We finished dinner just in time to get to their 7:30pm end-of-day sales! I ended up taking home a container of dukbokki (stir fried rice cakes with spicy sauce) for $3.49, a dish of fried zucchini for $2.79, a container of spicy fried tofu for $2.00, a container of soondae (Korean blood sausage) for $3.84, and a container of pork bone soup for $3.84. These are the prices after they had each been marked down between 30% and 50% off! Yeah. I like my discount end-of-day food. Now I won't have to cook lunch tomorrow! Hurray for Galleria!\n",

      "This review is regarding the food in the food court.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably my go to place for Korean food. The prices are very reasonable and there's lots to choose from! You can order things from the menu, buy pre-made food (ex. Bimbap, Korean fried chicken, etc.) and also buy food by pound (like buffet). My favourite here is the \"jajiang mein\" (black bean sauce with noodles). \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like Korean supermarket. The products are more fresh and healthy than the ones from mainland China. The  products may be a bit expensive than the ones from Chinese supermarket but still in a reasonable range. \n",
      "\n",
      "The special thing of the supermarket is there's a cafeteria area inside. If you are rushed for you lunch, you can picked up some ready-made dishes for your lunchbox. Some dishes are as good as regular Korean restaurants. Don't forget the steamed rice, it always goes with Korean dishes if you want to try the food in a more Korean manner. This more buffet-like way, I think, it's really a fast way to get your stomach filled nicely. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can also order the food from menu. And it won't make you wait for too long. \n",
      "\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Galleria has everything!   Fresh fruits and vegetables, lots of meats, and a plentiful variety of cooked foods.  You need beauty products?  Check.  How about a kimchi fridge?  Check.  U need a fishing outfit?  They have that too.  It's like one stop shopping.  They have great sampling stations, even a few on weekdays.  Psy is on repeat, playing in the background.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is not the store you can come in and just pick up one thing. Unless I stay focused, I usually am distracted with all the good food. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing for sure, is that the place is clean and neat. All the produce is stocked like someone with OCD had to do it. \n",
      "Although a lot of the Asian produce is being sold here, remember this is a Korean supermarket. Bean sprouts and cabbage is cheap, but other chinese veggies may not be. \n",
      "Apples are quite expensive at least $1.50\\/lb. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're also looking for Asian snacks, you can find Japanese and Korean nibbles here, but chinese ones are hard to find. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was also looking for chicken today, but unless I got an organic whole chicken, it was of no avail. They have lots of beef short ribs (yum hard to resist) either marinated ($23+) or not ($18+), and pork. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really like the hot food section, and I can take home a huge container of bulgolgi for $5.\n"

      "Galleria is Korea's answer to T&T's. This location is huge!! You can find so many interesting grocery items here... from their in-house made kimchi and tofu, to kalbi beef, to different kinds of teas (including the 'ballerina tea' to apparently cause weight loss:S), all kinds of dumplings, and fun snacks. It is quite organized, clean, and super air-conditioned (I visited on a hot summer day). In addition to groceries, you can find beauty products like sheet masks and there is even a travel agency! Oh, and they sell Kimchi fridges! Yes, that is a thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "As others have mentioned, order the fried chicken so that you can shop and by the time you are done it will be ready! (They give you a buzzer so you can wander around and it will go off when your chicken is ready). The chicken is really messy to eat because it is covered in a sticky, sweet and spicy sauce. But it is sooo crispy and delicious!! You can buy side dishes to go with it. I'm partial to the kimbap rolls. There is a food court style seating area. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is some kind of rewards card, which might be worth it if you come here often enough.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "So many options. Great place to rest and eat after grocery shopping. I went on a day thay the pork bone soup was yhe days special, it was only around 6. The thing they give you after your order will vibrate when food is ready, which is pretty cool.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ate here last Thursday morning, and I enjoyed it. I was seated immediately, and after asking what I would like to drink, which was coffee and water, my drinks were promptly delivered. I ordered the Macho Nacho, and it was delicious. I will be back again to try other selections on the menu.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful staff! The food is good too. I love the Hot Juan Burrito, and the pancakes are also great. I have found the French toast a bit dry. The dining area is large and bright. It's very welcoming. I highly recommend The Good Egg.\n",

      "So I have been coming here off and on for years. I just forget to leave a review, don't know why?? Anyway, me and my wife like coming here on weekdays, weekends are really busy, this is a very popular place. Love the omelets, and pancakes are very good. Great staff {5-Stars} If you have coffee, they bring you your own pot, nice touch!  Now I am a picky eater, so the one thing I don't care for are the potatoes that come as a side with most breakfast orders. They are mushy, not really crisp, not my style, not seasoned, just plain. One more thing, is the seating. There is no soft seats in this place. All booths are wooden benches. If you have back issues like me, then a long time here on your behind, might cause a bit of pain in ye'ol back. That being said, of course I will be back!!!!! another plus to this place is they have a stamp card, and every meal you purchase, you get a stamp. After 7 stamps you get a free meal, and ion Mondays, you get 2 stamps per meal, this is a great deal!! So i have to give a big Woo Hoo!!!!!\n",

It's OK because I stole bread off my boyfriends' plate and gave him one of my HUGE biscuits\\/gravy,lol.  The meal was still delicious. We got a side of bacon.  The bacon is thick, long, and extra salty.  Think beef jerky.  My boyfriend loved it and I didn't.  I think next time, I will ask for the bacon not to be cooked well done.\n",

I thought the waiter's happiness level was appropriate (I don't need coffee to wake up) and he made sure to check in regularly.  I thought the staff went out of their way to make sure everyone was happily satisfied.  I watched them and they seemed to be quick to make sure turnover kept the wait reasonable.  \n",

My omlette had tons of stuff in inside, the prices were reasonable (you can add bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc to any meal for $1 each). The menu is huge, the company I was with had a chicken salad sandwich, biscuits with gravy, and mushroom caps smothered with cheese. Everyone loved their meal and cleaned their plate. \n",

      "So I am going to let you in on a secret, sometimes (meaning once a week) I drop my kids off at school, ignore my other responsibilities for the morning and  go to The Good Egg for breakfast. I always know what to expect, great service, great food and great prices. They have yet to let me down. Can't wait for school to start again, so I can get back to playing hooky and hang out at The Good Egg.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was okay and delightful. We waited for about 10 minutes. For a cheap meal this is the place to go. Noticed a lot more senior citizens around here.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great little breakfast place with lots of options to choose from. If you're going to come in the morning on a weekend you need to either get here really early or much later. Around 9-11 it is packed and their is a wait. \n",
      "\n",

      "Before I became gluten free my favorite thing to get was the banana chocolate chip pancakes. They are huge, enough to feed three people! The bacon is also delicious and the orange juice tastes very fresh. After I discovered I had a gluten allergy I was disappointed to find out I was much more limited. Even the appearing innocent bacon and scrambled eggs had gluten (from the egg substitute) so there is not nearly as much to enjoy here if you are gluten intolerant. If you are gluten free and looking for some good breakfast places check some of my other reviews\n",

      " \n",
      "I went on a friday morning around 10:30 and still had a wait. I am told to expect a wait no matter what. Its a very good idea to check this place out if you are around town.\n",

The establishment is clean, wait times even during their busier times aren't painful (15 minutes or so).  The tables are consistently set and clean.  The bathroom as well, while small in size, is cleanly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has a variety, but not an overwhelming amount of options.  That is a good thing.  There's something for everyone, don't get me wrong.  Now as far as your options go you can expect your garden variety breakfast items to choose from.  The coffee is good as is.  I'm a fan of them leaving the pitcher of water and coffee pot at the table.  The food is good, not great, but good.  They have a cinnamon roll here that's the size of a dinner plate.  I love cinnamon rolls, but not the biggest fan of theirs.  It has the taste and consistently of a yeasty dinner roll, with some cinnamon and sugar, slathered in icing.  If that's more your style, by all means try it.  It wasn't bad, just not my favorite.  \n",

I had the catfish sandwich. Catfish being the special at the time. I think they specialise in bottom feeder (cheaper) fish, but do it well! The catfish definitely had some seasoning to it. I also dared to try some of their BBQ sauce on it. And I liked it... The sauce was sweet and spicy.\n",

      "After having a few bites at another restaurant on College, my friend and I decided to try The Fish Store & Sandwiches. We only had room for something small, so we decided to share an order of Arctic Char fish tacos. Each of the four tacos was filled with two chunky pieces of fish that was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection, along with some lettuce and red onions. (It was our first time trying Arctic Char, and we both felt it tastes similar to salmon but lighter, less fishy.)\n",

      "\n",
      "The store itself is so tiny, you can barely fit 5-6 customers there at the same time.  It's a mom and pop kind of place afterall.  You order the type of fish you like (the fish selection lies on a bed of ice, and yeah it smells a little fishy), and then you order the other toppings, whether you want bread, or salad, or rice to come with the fish.  They also list their daily special fish on the board.  Price varies from $7 to $12, depends on the type of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've ordered the clam chowder soup, one halibut sandwich, one daily special (grouper) sandwich, and a wild sockeye salmon salad.  We were told to wait about 15-20 mins while the fish was grilled.  The fish was perfectly cooked and was very juicy.  The soup was less creamy and thick than what you normally have in other restaurants, but still it had enough clams. What amazed me was that the bread was so fresh and fluffy!\n",
      "\n",
      "We went there around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, and we still saw streams of customers coming in.  I can imagine how busy this place would become during its rush hour.  You can either wait outside where there is a tiny patio, or you can walk out and come back in 10-15 mins.  Trust me, it's all worth it!\n",

They do put lemon pepper on it, which i could live without (a squeeze of lemon or lime would be way better - i will probably ask them to do that next time).

I had randomly found this place while reading blogs and I'm quite surprised there aren't more reviews for this place yet. Nestled in Little Italy a few blocks west of bathurst, this little hole in the wall store doesn't really boast a lot of decor. There is a selection of fresh fish inside, a drinks display, cash register and kitchen. There is a small outdoors patio where a handful of people can sit and enjoy their meal. For approximately $8-$10 you are given only a sandwich. Accompaniments are charged extra. I recommend going with the catch of the day if you don't know which fish to get. Don't worry about how to get it seasoned, the cooks take care of it!\n",

I also really liked the fish because it's grilled not breaded and I think you can taste the fish more when it's not covered in batter. They also put a generous portion of fish on the sandwich so I was glad I didn't order any sides. They have 15 different types of fish everyday so I will definitely go back to try some others. They have plate options too if you don't want a sandwich. Only 2 tables inside so it's better as a take away place. And it's cash only. Every sandwich is between $9-$11 so it's a great deal. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it would have been nice with a spicy mayo sauce or something like that.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Honestly I've always loved this place, I always get the plate with rice and vegetables. Their house made salad dressing it the best, it's a miso dressing. It's a healthy and filling meal. I've always wanted to try the sandwich but haven't because of their pricing system where it's the same price to get either a plate, or a salad, or a sandwich. The plate is obviously better value, whereas the sandwich seems overpriced at over ten bucks...you can get the 5 dollar special sandwich but it's tiny apparently. Also, their prices in general have gone slightly up and they now charge extra for avocado whereas it used to be just a part of the meal and really brought the value up in my eyes. And...this isn't my personal story but my boyfriend told me the last time he went there he ordered a sandwich and the lady asked if he wanted to add avocado, he said yes, but there was already avocado on the sandwich then she also added an unnecessary half avocado on the side, and the avocado costs like $2.50... That's the price of buying an avocado at most markets... So obviously my issue is with the pricing. The people who own it are really nice, they are a family. I've had a couple different people say that on single occasions they've gone in and the people were kind of rude, but I usually tell people to cram it when they say that because they're allowed to have different moods. They've always been really nice in my experience. I think they have a good thing going, there's no other place like them in Toronto.\n",

      "This is a small joint that has delicious and fresh seafood. It's a great spot to go to in the summer time. Not so in the winter if you want to sit down. The halibut sandwich was very flavourful and the bun was super soft. Really yummy! I've had the wild salmon and the rainbow trout on rice before and both comes with korean rice and miso sauce that goes amazing with the fish. Though I would like the fish to be grilled and not pan fried. The flavour of the food makes up for it! Go if you are close by!\n",

I mean, it consisted of  burger buns, lettuce, swiss cheese, onion, tomato, and about 6 sizzling, crunchy shrimp which to my knowledge didn't have too much garnish. Still, the combination was oddly very satisfying. I like my food to have a lot of flavour through sauces, herbs and spices, but the dressing wasn't at all necessary. Great little place.\n",

Halibut was cooked perfectly, fish was delicate and seasoned well, my only nitpick would be that it needed some sort of a cream sauce. It tasted like it had a balsamic vinegrette drizzled onto the fish, and it soaked onto the foccaccia bun. Overall I was pleased, from what I remember I almost paid 20 dollars for a drink sandwich and salad so it was rather pricy. It's a very small place with a few tables outside so your best option might be take out.\n"

Ordered 2 sides of avocado but only received but it was too late as we did not check til we got home.  The burrito was good but I had my mind set on a sandwich so I was a little disappointed.  Salad was really good, veggies were all fresh and the salmon cooked perfectly.  The soup was a bit of a let down though.

Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are cut right next to the fish refrigerator, encasing a wide selection of fish like salmon, shrimp, cod, talapia, etc. Concept: you pick the meat (specials change daily, but prices are usually consistent i.e., salmon is $6.99 for a sandwich. Fish is marinated with a special blend of spices, which all fold into a soft roll. No extra sauce needed. But we discovered a cinnamon-ade ($3.50 will get you a 16 ounces of refreshing accompaniment to the sandwiches. Once grouper sandwich + white fish burrito + large cinnamon-ade for just under $20 CAD. I will definitely return and recommend this place for anyone who enjoys supporting the moms and pops establishments while indulging in fresh, tasty food for cheap!\n",

The Fish Store has been around for a while and they serve quality fish dishes with fresh ingredients (you can actually see the raw fish on ice). If you are in Little Italy and looking for something fast, yet healthy, this is your best option. Most of the other places around here are shawarma\\/pizza\\/burrito places. \n",

For any fish, they grill it fresh to order and you can have it as a sandwich, salad, burrito, or over rice. They don't overseason it, so you can really taste the flavour of the fish. I had the haddock salad ($9.99) and it came over a huge portion of mixed romaine and baby spinach with lots of veggies. In addition to fish, they have soups and cold drinks. Be sure to check out the daily special too!\n",

We like a little more spice to our food, however and will order our dishes with a little extra heat next time.

I ordered everything 'spicy', but I think that next time I'll send a message asking for 'extra spicy' (maybe with an added message saying that I'm Mexican and can handle it...). I've got a cold right now that I'm trying to burn out of my sinuses, so I was hoping for some really good heavy spice that would send me into a flop sweat. I can understand them wanting to err on the conservative side, since I'm SURE they've gotten orders sent back by Gilbert whiteys because \"it was just too spicy!!\". But when someone checks the 'spicy' box, they need to get their buttholes ready because the food SHOULD be spicy! Just sayin'.\n",

The samosas are delicious as well. I forced myself to branch out one time and got the chicken curry, it was pretty good but I didn't feel like it had as much flavor as the Tikka Masala. I would like to come try the buffet one day, but so far have only gotten take out. Definitely worth giving this place a try!\n",

      "First time here and the food was delish.  We had tikki masala, chicken curry and palak paneer.  Next time we'll skip the chicken curry and double up on the masala - it was super yum.  I don't care for palak paneer in general - but this had a really nice deep rich spiced flavor.   Garlic Naan was very good - and the rice comes with the food (and extra for $.99 - not the $3-4 for rice some places charge).   They said the veggie korma came with brocolli - which I can't eat - so I didn't get to try one of my favorite things - time to find a new favorite thing!\n",

The garlic naan is also delicious. Oddly they tried to get us to order two orders of garlic naan right off the bat, but we declined. One was more than enough for two people. The bowl of rice that comes with the order is pretty small, but it's good. Could definitely have used a second one of those. Ended up being $36 with tax and tip for two dishes and naan, which is a little high, but I'd probably still go back.\n",

On a plus side it was only $20 plus tax per person which is cheap for a nice hotel like this one. My party was all M Life members with gold status and as we stood in the M Life VIP line and the women at the register helped four other people we were confused. Then the points from the Mlife help desk that we had just left to set up a buy one get one free for lunch didn't transfer so it was a bit of a \"starting off on the wrong foot from jump.\" The waiter was nice and attentive.\n",

The prime rib was fabulous. The crab legs were dry and the dessert was lacking in my opinion. I would have killed for a warm brownie. But over all a good choice and yummy. Great when you can't decide what you want.\n",

I think for the price tag for their brunch it really nailed the spot! The prime rib and the braised ox tail hit the spot BIG TIME! I believe that both of these items are what makes this buffet worth it. The crab for me was too dry but the meats for the most part were tender and juicy! I think the prime rib and the ox tails were the only highlights to this meal, everything else was just mediocre. Service here was great!

      "I visited during the holiday season, so we paid $32.60 per person for their holiday special, which lasts all day. If you're coming here for interesting food options, then you're better off at other buffet places on the Strip, like Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan. Lastly, if you're dining during the day, ask for seating next to the windows; you can bask in the warm sunlight. That's the beauty of being out in the desert in the winter.\n",

      "When in Vegas might as well hit up a buffet and this was the most convenient one to go to and considering the cost for their weekend brunch and the selection and quality of their proteins I was not disappointed.  The ones that I enjoyed and went back for seconds were the marinated steak, prime rib, osso bucco and the oxtail stew. I was in a meat coma afterwards. I also enjoyed their collard greens and steamed veggie mix of squash\\/carrots\\/broccoli - had to make sure I ate my veggies too.\n",
      "I generally don't have a sweet tooth but I decided to indulge of some of their dessert treats since we were on vacation anyway. I tried and enjoyed a bit of their bread pudding, classic cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake, berry cobbler, and apple pie ala mode. Man was I over my daily caloric intake for the day! Hahaha. We also had coffee, hot tea, and pineapple juice (not always available so bonus that they had it). Service was decent although she did forget the juices initially. Would consider coming back here especially if staying here at the resort.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had dinner here for my first time (and probably my last) at this buffet. Some people are probably easily fooled into thinking that the food here is really good just because the dining room is so picturesque. I mean it was nice, sitting on the patio with a view, but it pretty much ends there. I must have taken one bite of everything on my plate and pushed it aside. The carrot cake was the only thing that I thought was good enough to finish. It's definitely not worth the wait. For around the same price though, I'd rather be at Paris or the Bellagio buffet.\n"

That's just too bad I say though because my three mimosas would have tasted much better with a do-it myself omelet or a waffle bar.  They were good regardless, but the delicious bacon wrapped pork, or the fried shrimp just didn't do to my belly what i had wanted to happen.  I wanted magic.  I wanted taste explosions.  I wanted my stomach to thank me personally.  But all that happened was a too full belly, $20 i'll never get back, some wasted food on multiple plates, and some nasty gas.\n",

They make omelets, bbq ribs, roast beef, Chinese food, scrambled eggs, bacon, turkey bacon, sausages, rolls, crab legs, fruit,  oatmeal, grits, cerals boxes, desserts, etc. Our waitress was nice with good on refills.  No lines and they offer self online registers.\n",

However, under no disclosure, the kids price was not honored to use for the coupon. \n",

The fresh blackberries\\/blueberries were fresh, though when it was out, they replaced it with Strawberries instead.  The kids got their milk in plastic disposable cups.  The champagne tasted quite good, though I just had 1\\/2 glass and had to drive after breakfast. The pastries like the croissant and some desserts (ie. bread pudding) were excellent as well.  I would say $30 for breakfast is a tad on the high side but unfortunately, we came on a Friday instead of a Thursday morning and that was the only choice available. \n",

      "Mediocre buffet at best. I stay and play at Mandalay Bay quite frequently and the buffets usually come either complimentary or they come with the stay when I book a reservation. The last stay I completed with Mandalay Bay I received the two buffets and when we arrived there was nobody at the host station. Odd.. especially for a peak busy weekend night. I started at the pizza station where I found most of the pizza burnt with the lack of tomato sauce. Pepperoni pizza that had about 3 and a half pieces of pepperoni lol. The Italian station was just as bad and I think I was only impressed with the meatballs and kept it moving. The carving station usually is my favorite and even that was off. Meat looked so dry and just not even appealing to eat! The service was actually good and our waitress was very attentive with keeping the drinks filled. I believe that if they could only improve on the food quality that would help the foot traffic of this buffet. You have to ask yourself sometimes why are they offering the buffet for free with certain promotions on the room. It's a marketing strategy that obviously helps increase the number of people to visit and eat. But it's going to take more than just an offer to come eat comp'd for me.. I need the food to improve.\n",

      "Our family went to the buffet on a Sunday around 1:00, there wasn't any wait.  It seems a little over priced at $29 for what you get.  The upside - hot crab legs and prime rib, the prime rib seemed to be hit or miss on the cut, some were OK and some were very fatty. The kids loved the breakfast items and the dessert bar, waffle cones were a big hit.  The down side, the service.  Our waiter came back once to refill drinks then was MIA. At some point another server started taking our plates but we ended up having to stack them on another table.  The kids loved it.  I would have rated it a little higher for $20, but not that great for $29.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "$23 for lunch. Plenty of seating spaced apart. Wednesday around 12:40pm no wait whatsoever. Their sushi selection is lame (four grocery quality rolls) but they had a better Chinese selection (fried rice, show mien, sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, tofu, pot stickers) than MGM Grand. They offered a pasta station where you chose the items and they cook for you (marinara or cream sauce; I chose Marinara and was less than impressed with the taste) Their Italian option is Bleh. Cici pizza looking slices, cheese ravioli and wrapped pasta. The carving station only offered beef or turkey. Shrimp cocktails were on the smaller side and not fresh ice cold. A pretty impressive selection of protein: oxtail, veal, pork chop, ribs, different types of chicken, and fish. As I was staying in the Southside, coming here was easy using the tram from Excaliber. Not sure I would bother venturing here otherwise  unless I was already around here. It's really not that bad of an option, I only came because I had a complimentary pass. It turned out better then expected after yesterday's disappointing MGM Grand Buffet experience.\n",

Paid about $30 at the kiosk, and were immediately seated.  Service was great. Food wasn't bad, and there were plenty of non seafood options to choose from as well. For someone who doesn't typically enjoy buffets, I definitely ate my money's worth. \n",

      "Oh...goodness. Like many of the hotel buffets in Vegas, this place offers the \"Eat All Day Long\" option. My family took up this challenge, mostly for the deal. It's a pretty good buffet, but eating all three meals here is a bit...much. I totally regretted going for it. But eating one meal here is not so bad. \n",
      "The dessert section was definitely the highlight, but isn't that always the case? I liked the fruit tarts and mousse. They also have a small cylindrical cheesecake sample that is the perfect size. All cheesecake portions should be that size...seriously.\n",
      "The evening of my battle with this buffet also happened to be the same day that the GameStop convention was being held at the Mandalay Bay. This meant many, many hungry gamers in the hotel. It was extremely annoying to have to wait in a super long line for food at a buffet. I don't even understand why people were lining up, but in fear of being accused of cutting, I joined the flock. But even with the insane amount people (most of them gamers), the service was great. \n",
      "I don't know if it's worth the price for one meal, but eat enough crab meat and blackberries and you'll probably get your money's worth.\n",

      "A Recovering Stomach\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm going to preface this by saying part of our hotel booking included credits for a daily buffet, for the two of us. Had it not been for those credits, we probably wouldn't have bothered going at all. With those credits, we went 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed. For it being the Mandalay Bay, I honestly expected a better buffet. Having read previous reviews though, I knew not to expect too much...and even then, it was still vastly underwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first visit was during the dinner hour and, luckily, we got there before the rush (though, you wouldn't know it because it was still a madhouse). Best part? There was a couple who partook in the unlimited beer\\/wine thing they had, and the lady drunkenly HUGGED the dude behind the counter before exclaiming how drunk she was. Vegas at its finest. Worst part? The service. We probably had 4 plates on our table before our dude finally picked them up, we always had to ask for refills...and I'm not really sure why it's seemingly allowed to have children LAY on the floor in the middle of the walkways while their parents eat at a table. Maybe that's not a MB thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Second visit was during their champagne brunch buffet, and that was at least more worth it for me...if only because I took advantage of the cheap champagne and had several glasses with my cranberry juice. This visit had much better service than the first, which was surprising because it was WAY busier.\n",
      "\n",
      "So again...had it not been for those credits, we wouldn't have bothered with the buffet. Especially if the lines were as long as they were during our stay there. Also? Don't eat the sushi...the one I picked up smelled like it was rotting.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My coworkers and I met here for breakfast last week when in Vegas for a trade show.  We had the buffet but I found it confusing and congested, and difficult to navigate.  That and the food offered was nothing real special.  Wouldn't probably choose to go back again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Did whole day buffet deal  ($43)on a Sunday. Brunch included champagne and had a wide variety of breakfast\\/lunch items including omlettes, crab legs, sushi, steaks including prime rib, fruit, cheeses, tamales, carnitas, potstickers, spring rolls, lamb chops, smoked salmon and trout, and a wide variety of desserts. Dinner was less impressive with many of the brunch items still on the menu - but no champagne. \n",
      "\n",
      "Probably better to do the whole day buffet deal on regular weekday and just do the brunch on Sunday. Service was good and the ambiance is good. Highlight was the crab legs and desserts.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We did the Sunday brunch buffet and it had lots of offerings. Some items were a little dry or hard (pancakes, French toast sticks, etc). Other items were delicious and I paid the extra to have the endless \"Brut\". The waitress was a little sarcastic when I needed extra orange juice to out with my champagne, so that was annoying, but she did eventually bring it out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Service was great. Patrons around us not so much. To maximize your value, start with the item you really want to eat first. Flank steak, beef short ribs, all excellent. The flatbread pizzas are AMAZING!! Crab legs were mediocre. Word to the wise wait till they bring fresh ones. Don't eat the crab legs that are at the bottom of the Schaffer.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We succumbed to laziness and ate here. We know it's over priced and the food are your regular buffet menu. Except for the ox tail. A bit chewy but at least it's something new. \n",
      "\n",
      "What more can I say... bleh.\n",

      "Went for lunch.   There was only a small percentage of items that even looked appetizing for me to try.  Also this buffet did nearly nothing to try to separate itself from even low end vegas buffets which is a shame considering its one of the top MGM resorts in Vegas.   No crab legs for lunch, no made to order waffles or crepes, not even a gelato station.  They did have a made to order pasta station but I found the options of what could be made there half hearted.\n",
      "On a positive their flank steak had great flavor and their carved new york loin roast was well above par as far as buffet carving roasts go.  Also you couldnt go wrong with the large cocktail shrimp.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We were starving after arriving and checking in to the hotel. We walked around the casino stopping to look at the menus posted outside of the different restaurants and so many entrees were $20-$30 for just a salad or a sandwich so when we saw that the all you can eat brunch buffet was only $25.99 we were sold! My husband who loves his meat dishes was in meat heaven. He loved loved loved the korean flavored marinated steak. He also enjoyed the prime rib, oso bucco and oxtail. I'm more of a seafood fan and was not as impressed with the selection. My go to dish at any buffet are the crab legs and the crab legs here are by far the scrawniest crab legs I've ever had. They also had shrimp cocktail which tasted fine, mussels, and a small selection of sushi which was more rice than actual fish. I saved a little room for dessert and thoroughly enjoyed their oreo cheesecake and soft serve ice cream in a waffle cone. Overall not a bad deal for the price, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back, but if I was already staying in the Mandalay or Delano, I'd be willing to eat here again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "***$27.99 dinner buffet**** I would have thought that for this price, I would have had great food..... unfortunatly not. I was very diappointed, I went last fall and it was great. Now its shity service, slow waiters, bad food etc..... The only thing I did enjoy were the crab legs... which I ate the most of. I will not return here and pay this hideous amount of money. It Sucks !\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Huge variety of food nice staff good deal\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food selection and quality are a bit above average for a buffet.  The $42.99\\/all day pass is definitely a bargain, but you'll end up eating too much and wondering why the heck you couldn't just be satisfied with one plate, since it's just not that good.  I'd recommend filling up on the shrimp\\/salmon\\/beef and skipping the sushi and greasy looking options.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had myVegas reward points to redeem at this buffet, so we decided to try the brunch\\/lunch on a weekday. The breakfast was okay and tasted like any other breakfast place like IHOP or Denny's. However, they do have delicious lox and crepes. The wait for the brunch was not too long and the service was excellent. The waitress for our table was very helpful and attend to our needs frequently. I would like to try their dinner buffet next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I dined here last Saturday during lunch and paid about $43 for two people. They have a lot of food choices, although I would rate the taste of all the dishes I tried as a MEH. They did refill the sodas and waters on a consistent basis and the staff was pleasant and professional. I think I enjoyed the desserts the best; Everything I tried was good. My favorite was the coconut and pudding concoction.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kinda disappointed in the quality of food at breakfast. I'd eaten the dinner buffet in the past and was satisfied. I loved the pasta bar, so I was excited to be up early enough to catch breakfast however, I was let down. The food was hardly seasoned, all rolls or biscuits were like rocks. And the options were few, each side had the same selection. The server Gloria was great but I don't think I'll be eating breakfast here again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was okay, pretty average. I don't feel that it was worth the money. There is free alcohol but it's only a few select wines and just bud light. There is a decent selection of food, and what was available was good so no complaints.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Way to expensive for what you get. The choices where limited and not real value. Quality was average not more. Family of four was over $120. Not worth it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We came here for breakfast and there was no wait.  However, one table had four people smoking and the server didn't do anything about it.  The service was prompt and the place was clean.  The food was OK for the price.  We'll be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think 3.5 stars is about right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here last Saturday night after narrowing it down to Rio and Mandalay Bay.  Mandalay Bay won out this time because we ate at Rio the last time we were in Vegas.  It's always good to try something new, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "For about $30, you're treated to a better-than-average Vegas buffet.  I think for about $35, you can eat all day long. I'm not really sure if that requires you sitting in the restaurant all day and eating, or whether it means you can leave and come back to eat whenever you want.  Either way, it sounds awesome; I mean, I think the prospect of having a buffet be your day-long prison is a pretty sweet and ridiculous idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, here are some highlights:\n",
      "+ Lots of seafood!  Crab legs! Many salmony salmons! White fishies! Scallops!  Big shrimp!  Yay scavengers of the sea!\n",
      "+ Meats!  Chicken legs! Fried! Veal! Stewed! Prime rib! Other many meats for to eat!  Even though I've been trying to eat less red meat, I was like oh screw it, I'm eating well tonight!\n",
      "+ The Asian foods:  not spectacular, but I still appreciate it being there.  Sushi, pot stickers, Chinese foods, etc.  All decent-tasting!\n",
      "+ Desserts!  Many! All good!  That's saying a lot!  Because I don't have a sweet tooth!\n",
      "+ And one of my FAVORITE parts of the meal: they had CHEESES!  I am a lover of the CHEESES, so when I saw the CHEESES I got all drooly and excited and piled all the CHEESES (they's got blue CHEESES, other hard CHEESES that I can't remember, etc.) on my plate, and that was my dessert.  Loved the addition and the tastes of the CHEESES.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must also note that the dining rooms are very pretty, with dim lighting and a comfortable atmosphere.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, overall, I enjoyed this buffet a lot, wasn't blown away, but would consider coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, if you're deciding on ONE buffet to eat in Vegas, you gotta hit up the Rio buffet.  It is KICK ASS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aite, and with that, I'm out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has the crab and the jumbo shrimp but for some reason there seafood has no flavor. I think they probably boiled the crap out of it. Selection was modest and the quality of the other goods were pretty good. The prime rib was so rare it was still mooing which was great, very nicely done. Deserts were disappointing with the selection and quality. The had bread pudding without the white sauce, which really doesn't work. Service is also quite slow so it might take some time to clear the table of seafood rampage.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here for breakfast since we had a gift card from staying at this hotel. Nice selection of food although I noticed a lot of the food was cold. The herb crusted salmon was cold which wasn't good at all. The bacon was super greasy. The hash brown was good, but cold. The fruits were yummy and sweet. Some of the meat was too dry. Food was a miss for me but service was great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had their brunch. It was decent. The french toast sticks were good quality.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "While my wife and I only had breakfast and brunch here, we did go twice, so I feel this review is representative of the kind of food and service you should expect.  The hostess service that works the line after payment takes longer than expected to get you to your table considering it is a buffet.  I guess there are still server sections, so maybe this makes sense.  I was glad to see a hot carafe of coffee already on the table as we sat down.  The server will then take your drink order for nearly any other juice or hot beverage.  The first thing I'll mention about the food selection is that the prime rib was surprisingly good, I mean really good.  There was a nice salty, herb crust on the outside which was quite satisfying.  The omelet station was very busy, but the cook was quickly working 5-6 omelets as once, while dealing out Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay anecdotes.  Nice touch and better than staring blankly at him while he cooks.  The cheese blintz were quite good and very addictive.  I'd recommend throwing some strawberry sauce on top.  If you are a carb-ovore, you will be pleased with an entire bakery selection on the opposite side of the dining area.  Overall, a nice breakfast, but nothing that will be memorable outside of this review.  It's relatively inexpensive at $17 for breakfast and $24 for brunch (in terms of Las Vegas anyhow.)  It is also convenient, especially if you are coming from THEhotel or the Mandalay Bay hotel rooms on your way to the convention center.\n"

      "Good but not great. I compare every buffet to\n",
      "The Aria buffet which is a 5 star buffet. Good staple buffet and only $5 for endless mimosas which was great. They served all the staple buffet foods such as  shrimp, crab legs, steak, mashed potatoes, pancakes, fish, chicken. It was enjoyable and we would recommend it\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was good but not the best. Server did a great job with getting drinks and plates out the way. But wouldn't recommend going there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Another typical breakfast buffet restaurant. Service was excellent, server was very attentive not a large buffet selections but it is a quality not the quantity that count for me. Fruits were sweet and fresh. Ordered omelette just tad overdone than I like but it was tasty.  Would I go back, yes for breakfast.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was decent, desserts were fabulous.  A lot of things lack labels, especially at the dessert station.  Ate here for lunch, okay selection of foods.  Turkey at the carving station was great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Buffets are not about quality, let's just get that right out there. Buffets are about QUANTITY and getting as much for your dollar as possible. Because of this, I'm generally not a huge fan of buffet style eating. But that aside, the Bayside Buffet isn't half bad when compared against others in Vegas. It has one distinct advantage for sure, FREE ALCOHOL. Yep, they have red and white wine and champagne and it's free. It's not high end but it's as decent as anything you'd be served on a plane. Every other buffet I've been too charged extra for alcohol of any kind. So free alcohol is a Bayside \"plus\". The food was ok, not tremendous but not bad. For seafood lovers they have crab legs, mussels, shrimp, Lox, baked salmon, baked swai (aka..basa) ,  a few different sushi rolls and cioppino (very spicy). The mussels were tender, not rubbery, and the baked fish dishes were both moist, not overcooked and dried out. The shrimp were a good size too. If you're not a fan of seafood, they have pizza (which looked decent), prime rib and chicken . For veggie lovers you'll find things like asparagus and corn on the cob. The dessert section is fairly vast as well with a nice assortment of fresh baked cookies, cobbler, tiramisu, bread pudding, carrot cake, chocolate cake, soft serve frozen yogurt and more. For the $30 entry price you will certainly get your monies worth. So if you're doing Vegas on a budget or simply don't feel satisfied by smaller restaurant portions, the Bayside Buffet just might be your thing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Bayside Buffet on Mandalay Bay Casino really upgraded this buffet. We went a few years ago and it was terrible. We read they had changed it and decided to give it a try, esp since the line was not long. We ate the lunch buffet on a Friday and it was excellent. Granted there was not a 300+ item selection like the fancier buffets, but they had enough good food. Great carved meat selection, italian selection, and other items. Also, had a new dessert bar, not a lot of choices, with personal service and great selection. Very good! Definitely will go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I hate the word buffet and I really hate the concept of a buffet but sometime I get roped into attending one of the feeding frenzies, but it's never my first choice. I will admit this isn't you're typical buffet but there's still the possibility that you will over eat if you don't show a little restraint. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what exactly does $32.95 get you, for one it gives you a choice to choose wisely or just be plain stupid. I usually like to do a tour before making my selections, the first thing I noticed was that all the serving dishes are small this is an added measure taken to protect the interest of The Bayside Buffet's owners but also protects you from yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always go for the carving stations and this buffet not only had plenty of those options but the quality was pretty good as well. My first plate held my prime rib, sliced turkey and a fried chicken breast and to be honest I loved every bite and could have stopped there but the trays of food were calling my name even though I chose to sit at a table as far away from the mounts of food as possible. My second plate was for the sushi and a few steamed dumplings and a few pieces of cheese. The most satisfying part of attending this buffet was the fact that I was able to avoid the cakes, pies, and cookies and even walked away from the donuts.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good and bad.  The carver took out a new roast because I wanted as close to rare as possible.  Bad is the snow crab legs, dry as dry can be and so little crab for all the work.  Las Vegas Buffet on Flamingo had better crab for 13$.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was a must come in vegas 10 years  ago, classy, wonderful quality of food and wide variety... they stopped improving their menu and now it seems just ordinary, even the Luxor buffet and Excalibur are WAAAAAY better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you're hungry and you're hungry? Eat here. It was late. We were hungry and were, well, in a hurry to eat. Didn't want to wait somewhere to sit and order and wait some more. I'd probably order a salad for the same price anyway thanks to ALL the overpriced Vegas food. This way I got  to eat what I wanted and had my coffee and cake too! \n",
      "I would never plan it this way though. Bellagio buffet is where my heat is.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay price with great service. The food selection leaves something to be desired during lunch and the food itself wasn't great. A lot of things were cold and tasted like it was made a few hours ago.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After visiting the buffet a few times I must say it was pretty good. I realize that in Las Vegas there are many better places for breakfast or brunch. However, the buffet was reasonably priced, a good selection of American Classic foods, Luis it's a buffet so in true American fashion you can eat all you can ;) \n",
      "\n",
      "The selection of food is quite decent, there are the usual so like scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, home fries, coffee, cereals, and so on. So it is a nice American style breakfast. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would certainly be back, as it's such an easy choice to make in the morning it's breakfast and it's a buffet what can go wrong?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We visited this buffet for dinner last night. The food was good. The server was terrible, we only drink water and we always had an empty cup. Our table of 4 guests had about 10 cups in the center when we left and we stacked our empty plates on an adjacent table.  For the $142 price tag, the overall experience left something to be desired, but I am happy the food was good. The crab legs were excellent.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've only been to \\/ in comparison to buffets at Aria, Cosmo & Bellagio, this was the smallest spread (but still plentiful, with a good variety). I don't recall anything that seemed to be a \"specialty\" to the buffet. However, the food itself was good and priced well. To me it's a buffet off the list, wouldn't plan to go back but if the group was going and \\/ or in the area I wouldn't be upset or mind going back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for dinner because of crab legs but they were cold. But they have a cook to heat it but, unfortunately the crabs were taken out of the water to soon and all of them except a couple legs were hot. Looks like the waitresses were over worked, but still did a good job.  Other than the crab legs every thing else was good.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I stay at MB fairly frequently, and often end up at their buffet. I'm never disappointed by their carving stations, their mashed potatoes are very creamy, and like that they have (American-style) Chinese food. They steam crab legs too, which is a big plus to my wife. Their desserts are so-so; they used to have a great mini-tirimisu that I could eat a half dozen of, but the last few times I did not see them there. Service is generally good as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'd like to give this place 3 1\\/2 stars but can't do that. Typically I round up, but I'm trying to rate all buffets equally and since I rounded down on the Bacchanal review I rounded down here too! Really, though, for the price this is a decent breakfast buffet. Well especially since it was free with a myVegas reward!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice ambiance, bright and airy. Great coffee, and excellent service. Typical breakfast buffet items, scrambled eggs, omelet station, miscellaneous other items. Nothing standout but nothing bad either. Given you would pay at least $5 for coffee and $5 for a pastry, this place really seems like a bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not something I'd go out of my way for but if you are in the area it's not a bad breakfast deal.\n",

      "The food here is mediocre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not bad, but not super good. If you're a foodie, you will have to choose wisely. Not everything in the buffet is good, but you must pick and choose. There are some diamonds in there.\n",

      "My husband and I came here on a Friday for lunch a few months ago. We had scored BOGO tickets for our meal. The meal was a GREAT deal! For the two of us (for a lunch buffet), we paid $23 total. I would definitely come back to this place in a heart beat. The value was phenomenal for the price. But of course for the next time I'd do the same thing, pick out the delicious things (and trust me, there are some- including yummy Lox!) out of the sea of mediocre food.\n"

      "First I have to say that the service was an A+!  The waiter was very attentive and very friendly.  We got there around 1pm and the food selection was great but the restaurant was not busy so the food turnover was not there.  I noticed that the sushi wasn't the freshest.  The avocado on some of them were browning and the fish just didn't look appealing at all.  I took the last avocado rolls and noticed that they did not refill the item the whole time we were there.  My husband enjoyed the freshly made pasta as he selected the pasta, sauce and fixing in the pasta.  They had a good selection of Asian, Mexican, Italian and American food.  The food quality was not the best but overall it was not the worse.  I just wonder if I had came earlier if the food turnover would have been better.  \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall, a pretty good buffet and experience. There was a very little wait for dinner, and the price was reasonable. The staff, from the hostess to our waiter, was all pretty friendly. The pasta chef was super kind, maintained a good conversation and taught me a little bit about the pasta sauce he was making which I thought was cool! \n",

My hubby suggested that we just dine at the Mandalay Bayside Buffet since since we were staying there...I immediately agreed.\n",

      "We arrived at the Bayside Buffet for Sunday dinner which cost $29 per person and there was no line...sweet.  They have kiosk stations where you can pay for your dinner buffet and then get seated.  The buffet area is not as large as I expected but included the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1)  Open Bar\n",
      "Unlimited champagne, white and red wine, and beer.  This was a pleasant surprise, especially since the champagne was pretty good.  Either get your drink at the bar area and\\/or just ask your server.\n",

      "Various types of desserts.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Bayside Buffet offers a great dinner value that includes your alcoholic drinks during dinner.  I would return for their crab legs and unlimited champagne.  3 Stars!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We went for Sunday brunch. It was definitely price friendly compared to other buffets we visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The breakfast options were great. Tons of meats and an omelette  and carving station. The bananas were brown and less popular food items looked like they had sat out a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desserts were average.\n",
      "\n",

      "We tried the Mandalay Bay's Bayside Buffet recently, where its $43 all-day pricing was set to save us $21 apiece. We planned on spending a quiet day at the hotel, anyway -- relax at the property's 11-acre beach between breakfast and lunch, and playing some slots and visiting the shark reef aquarium before dinner -- so we did not feel \"trapped\" there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast went well. The house coffee went beyond our expectations, the bacon was nice and crispy, and you could find all the usual breakfast suspects here like scrambled eggs, waffles and lots and lots of smoked salmon. What's more, there was a surprising inclusion of south-of-the-border Mexcian fare served up as well, including some very delicious tamales I just could not stop eating. Maybe the best tamales I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch was just fine. Prime rib and crab legs were now available, as were some scrumptious barbecued short ribs. The selection was decent, but not very exciting -- there was no \"wow\" factor. The flavors were good, but not great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choices at this time of day were also infused with many Latin American flavors, including chorizo and beef sausage, a pleasant tomatillo salad, and my favorite tamales. It was, however, a bit disconcerting to see my darling meaty corn husks piled up in the same hotel pan I had left them pining for my gullet several hours ago. Were they the same ones that were put out at breakfast?\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper was a lot less impressive, though maybe it was because we were still full from eating there twice that day already. Unfortunately, there was nothing new or spectacular offered that evening that we did not see at lunch time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure there were a couple of new Asian dishes and a curry or two, and there was some flank steak (that was just a bit tough to bite), but nothing else really worth mentioning. Even the pasta station that was in full swing that night and had a nice selection of sauces, came up short by serving pasta that not quite al dente.\n",
      "\n",
      "After getting our fill at breakfast and lunch, we felt another meal here was overdoing it, so we left feeling stodgy after a couple of bites, and ended up quelling our later-that-night hunger pans with a couple of Belgian beers and a some items off the bar menu at Tender in the nearby Luxor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did we get our money's worth?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would happily pay $15 for breakfast here, and even more so if I managed to get in as they were transitioning to lunch (just before 11 am). I also feel their $16 is a fair price for lunch, but again, I would try to make this a brunch visit, and would not eat both breakfast and lunch here, never mind three full meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, you'd have to value dinner here at $12 at least, to make this one-day pass worth it, and it could be, if you don't mind lots of routine and want to stick to a $42-a-day food budget.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kinda pricey for two people at dinner and the selection is not overly abundant. They did have some good lamb chops, prime rib, and crab legs when I was here. Plus they had an unlimited wine and beer bar. I am not sure I will be back\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Got a free buffet at Bayside from MyVEGAS and stopped in this evening. The good, desserts and a few different selections. The bad, really felt that the quality was low. The meat I got off the carving stations was cold. The fried chicken was good as was the meatballs. My server was attentive and my cup never went empty. If I had paid for this I would have been disappointed but it was worth what I paid, free.\n"

      "#1 Pro - best crab legs in a Vegas buffet (as far as I know). They are legit king crab legs.. you know, the huge, meaty ones with the sharp little things poking from the legs. \n",
      "\n",
      "#1 Con - dessert station... I mean, at least at the Bellagio, no matter how full you may think you are, one look and you find the tiniest space in your stomach to force something down. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other that, I love their eggs benedict and french toast. Their mac n cheese tasted like the cheese came from packs, their prime rib is alright, mashed potatoes are not as good as the Bellagio and Wynn. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if I'm comparing it so much to the Bellagio, why did I give it the same number of stars??... Crab legs, people. It's worth it if you are like me, and 95% of your Vegas buffet meal consist of crablegs, 2% is butter, and the last 3% consist of whatever else you feel like fitting into your life.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's your standard buffet fare.  Some good stuff, mostly mediocre stuff.  I went here for lunch and there was zero line on a Friday.  Price was also very fair for a Vegas buffet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I liked about the buffet a lot was the seating area overlooking the pool.  The huge windows windows added a nice feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couple things to note that I enjoyed were the oso buco, meatballs, salt and pepper shrimp, and sesame balls (in the chinese food area).  A couple of the desserts like the cheesecake and fruit cobbler was good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was an OK buffet.  If you're looking for excellent buffet food you would definitely be better off going to Bacchanal or something.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Given this is my third meal here during this stay (and I got one more to go), it warrants a review.\n",
      "\n",
      "If what you have in mind is a grand spread like Bellagio or Wynn, or Ceasars, it's a far cry.  Think more like when a hometown diner puts up a sign for \"all you can eat\" and adds some cheap $7.99 platter of late night Vegas style prime rib and super skinny crab legs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's a very convenient place if you're staying here to grab a quick light bite.  Yes, light, because since thanks to the warning of other yelpers I had appropriately lowered my expectations significantly, and can appreciate that I can get some steamed rice with lightly stir-fried or steamed veggies, and some meats that don't come with sauces, and platters of fresh fruits and berries in the morning.  You need a few light healthy meals while experimenting with all the amazing food options here, this isn't a bad place to make a pit stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention though that's also because we're staying here, and they've included 2 buffets for every night of our stay... else I may have a very different opinion at $29.99 a brunch.  On the bright side... no 2 hour lines either, just walk right in!  The deals on the Mandalay Bay website, highly recommend it if you're staying over the holidays and it'll at least get you a convenient meal for free.  One more meal here to go... I'll post pictures tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing worth mentioning is that the service is really friendly, and people are very nice here.  Will be back... tomorrow!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was pretty basic. We went for the $25 breakfast and the food was only ok. The real reason to go to this buffet is definitely the $5 bottomless champagne offer that they have! Since we were all a little hungover we just decided to stick with food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was ok. They had almost everything that you can imagine including fruit, bagels, smoked salmon, pancakes, eggs, bacon, omelette station, salad bar, Chinese food, sushi, carved meat, fresh seafood, muffins, cookies, pastries and more! If you are looking to eat a lot of mediocre food without breaking the bank then I would recommend. If you're a foodie, I would skip.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet USED to be a \"must try\" but now is just average. The service is average and quality is average.\n",
      "The per person price is definitely not the highest among other buffets. \n",
      "The wait is also not as long compared to a few years back (I visit LV almost every holiday). \n",
      "I did notice that over the years, they brought in more \"fillers\" like pastas, rice, etc. but what buffet hasn't taken that route?\n",
      "The dessert selection is still pretty good but that might just be my sweet tooth talkin. :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here was decent, though the selection for a vegas buffet was a bit underwhelming.  For the price though, $40 with tip for dinner, the selection is reasonable.  They had all the Vegas buffet staples, prime rib, shrimp, crab legs, etc.  Everything my group tried was good.  One bonus was that when we went on Valentine's day, they were serving complimentary champagne, wine, and beer.  The alcohol selection, however was not of very high quality.  The beer was bud light and the champagne was nothing to write home about.  For the price though, the return was reasonable.  Definitely worth it if you are not a foodie and are just looking to get your buffet on for under $50.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good buffet and I don't do buffets. Plenty of variety, the prime rib was perfectly seasoned and the cook working the omelet bar knew what he was doing. In my opinion the only room for improvement would be the desserts, I didn't have anything that wow-ed me.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a decent buffet but lacks the \"wow\" factor when it comes to presentation or varieties of foods offered.  Quality of prime roast was good and like many other Vegas buffets, had a decent selection of Asian dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ended up coming to bayside buffet as a last-minute decision. We were walking through the Mandalay Bay and we saw they had a good deal on the breakfast buffet with bottomless champagne. We figured why the heck we could give it a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "We walked in the house is very nice and set us quickly. The inside of the buffet was big not as big as some of the other Buffy is that I've been to but we were hungry so we definitely did the trick. We both got the bottomless champagne and I'm extremely sorry that I did because I ended up drinking at 9 AM and I ended up getting sick because I drink too much cheap champagne and I had to go to the room and lay down but that's my own fault. \n",
      "\n",
      "About the food so for breakfast they had all of the necessities that you would need eggs bacon sausage Hash. I found it interesting that even though we went for breakfast they still had lunch items out. You could still get chicken fingers cheeseburgers even had to stay carving station at 9 AM in the morning I was extremely impressed by that. You can get for lobster and crab legs at nine in the morning it was really interesting to see people actually getting crap legs at 9 o'clock in the morning. Their dessert station was fully open they had cheesecakes and pastries in all sorts of crazy desserts. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the taste of the food everything was fine I have no complaints the buffet was just your average run-of-the-mill buffet there was nothing special that set the Bayside buffet apart from some of the other buffet is that I've been to in Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the Bayside buffet was pretty good the bottom of champagne was a nice complement even know that I got sick but that is my own fault this buffet had everything that you would need to experience in a buffet although I would not say that it was the greatest or the most amazing buffet experience in Vegas that I have been to.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to a buffet experience I would def recommend coming here if not try one of the other buffets on the strip.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here on a Monday using the myVegas points for 2 for 1 for dinner. My wife and I arrived here early as possible since we know that there is going to be the dinner rush and they open at 4:30 pm. The surroundings is pleasant just like the hotel, the staff is kind, however the line was quite long because all the kiosk where down. If they had the kiosk operating, the wait wouldn't be that long. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we were seated, the waiter immediately requested our drinks and booked it to the crab legs since we basically went to the buffet just for them. The the endless crab legs hit the spot, specially with a side of melted butter! However the rest of the food were just okay. To summarize the rest of the selection is what you expect at a regular buffet.\n",
      "\n",
      "However with unlimited champagne and wine can't really go wrong. I would most likely go back only if I had a discount or some sort\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After a day of walking, the family and I came in here for some eats because why WOULDN'T you go to a buffet while in Vegas, right? :) \n",
      "\n",
      "The layout of this place was spacious and fancier than any other buffets I've been to. It was okay as far as food variety, and it all tasted fine. I think we came here close to dinner time, and I thought the cost was a little much. However, it included unlimited champagne so not a total bummer ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "If I was near by, I may come here again. However, I've been to a couple of other buffets where I enjoyed the variety more and would most likely pick over this one.\n"

      "Exterior: inside of Mandalay Bay. Pretty nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service: not the best at all. There was two people working at the cashier and there was two lines that combined as one once you get to the front. So who goes first then? Well, common sense wise, customers should take turns like the family in the left line goes first, then the right side, then the left side. When it was my family's turn though, the family next to us rushed in front of us and the people at our line were annoyed at how the other family did that. When we finally got to the cashier, the woman's attitude was not the best. Won't complain much since it was dinner service and she must have been tired but still...? A little smile or something would have been ok but all we got was an annoyed tone. Water was refilled often so that as good. The friendliest people here were the chefs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: for the price, I would say it's not worth it. Places like wicked spoon or the buffet at wynn charges a high price for lots of food. This place charges a slightly cheaper price but for a less amount of food. Not much variety and the sushi are terrible. The salmon sushi had no crab meat. Only hard rice and a cucumber. The tuna was somehow almost dark purple instead of red. Other food were average. Limited amount of desserts too. I'm a huge dessert fan and I have to say, the desserts were not the best either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel and the chef at the buffet made the experience nice. But the overall food quality and first impression at the cashier line didn't leave the best mark for me.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Why this buffet has been getting great raves baffles me, b\\/c from my own recent dining experience, there was nothing extraordinary about Bayside buffet's smorgasbord; True, crab legs\\/shrimp cocktail\\/lamb\\/sirloin and\\/or filet mignon are served, but so do other better buffet places the likes of Bellagio, Rio, Wynn, and Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paris buffet, in my opinion, still has the most flavorful spread.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Underwhelming compared to other buffets in town. Almost surprising that a hotel as nice as Mandalay would run such a dinky buffet. Go here if you are short on time or really tired. Otherwise, get out of Mandalay and try the Bellagio buffet or Wicked Spoon Buffet at the Cosmopolitan.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hey, when thinking about buffets on the strip, most are about the same. Bayside was literally right in the middle. The selection was, of course, huge. Quality of food was spotty, but they literally had a little of everything. Not a particularly pretty restaurant, but they have unlimited beer\\/wine\\/champagne. At $35\\/person, it's not a bad deal if you're hungry and wanna get your drink on :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been to this buffet over a dozen times over the years, mainly due to having a local family member consider Mandalay Bay their home base.  I feel like I'm always a little bit underwhelmed.  Don't get me wrong, the food is very good, but I just feel that there should be more selection.  I mean, you only have two 'hot' buffet lines, and you have some overlap between the two.  I just think that if I didn't have my familial reasons (along with the partial comp and line pass), I would probably be able to find a better buffet that is priced a little better and has more variety.  Overall three stars, if on food quality only, closer to four.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm very disappointed at the bayside buffet at the Mandela bay.. I'm sure I didn't expected a lot but it's a Friday night (weekend  special menu?)and $ 33.00 values. Sometimes it's so hard to be crossed out my buffet BUCKET list. All buffet menu foods are \"look a like, tease a like\"... lol\n",
      "This place is not that busy, that means food will be dried out forever and turn around time will be ever.\n",

I mean come on, the restaurant needs some type of renovation.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The prices here are good. Approx $20 per person. The food is okay. Its fresh and that matters most. I had the prime rip and it was nice and medium rare. The other dishes were not spectacular but better than simply edible. The service was good but the waitress thought we switched out a person. She asked my husband if he was the same guy that was sitting there a moment ago. I guess people try to cheat in these places but c'mon....It was over halfway through our meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I thought the waitress forgot my request for a steak knife (she didn't say anything about it when she was serving the table next to ours) she really didn't. It just took her a while. So I felt bad for mentally berating her for her ignoring my request.\n",

      "My friend and I decided on Mandalay Bay for the buffet, lines didn't appear long, and the price was decent for what you got at $33 per person. My friend praised the prime rib to the skies, and to my trained eye, it did look perfectly cooked. For myself, I found a decent selection of grilled and roasted veggies, some mediocre cream of mushroom soup, some decent desserts, and plenty of wine that I had just a bit of... decent wine, not the greatest, but a couple notches above two buck chuck. \n",

      "Bayside has one of the nicest dining areas among the Strip buffets.  The food selection is average and is good quality.  Iced tea is NOT brewed (a big \"no no\" in my restaurant evaluation criteria).  Compromise on dessert quality if you need to cut corners but make sure you fresh brew the iced tea.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The best item on the day I visited was the prime rib.  It was tender, had nice flavor and was not bloody so you know they roasted it a while.  The food selection is not as vast as Bellagio, Wynn or M Resort but the price is commensurate with the selection.  \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They have an omelet bar in the morning. The food is international from pot stickers to kielbasa sausage. The desserts are your typical cookies and little cakes. The coconut macaroons were good. The pot stickers were hard though. And some of the meat was not flavorful. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fruit is delicious and beautiful. They even serve pecans! The strawberries were a beautiful gemstone red.\n",

      "It's an okay buffet place that doesn't really have quality that can compare to the other vegas buffets.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "We went in at lunch.  It wasn't dead, but wasn't swamped either, but it took us awhile to get any water with our meal.  I had to chase down a wait her to get some!  However, he was quite attentive to us after that and even brought us our own caraffe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that really pulls this buffet down to 3 stars for me was all of the seafood that I tried.  I tried the cioppino, the panko salmon, and some sushi rolls.  I am a seafood fan, but this fish tasted TOO fishy, to the point where I only took a bite of each.  I love sushi, but by no means am a sushi snob (I will even go to a higher quality conveyor belt place and enjoy it), and the bite I took of my roll here made me feel sick to my stomach.  Sushi, in my opinion, should NEVER have a strong \"fishy\" taste, but this sushi did.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you steer clear of the sushi, though, there is SO much to choose from, and all of it that I tried is fantastic!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was in Las Vegas last month for a business trip and I came here for a quick lunch with a coworker. There was no line, we swiped our cards to pay ahead of time and we were seated promptly.  It was during the week, so maybe that's why it wasn't super crowded. \n",
      "\n",
      "You could even tip ahead of time. That always makes me nervous - will we get good service? The waitress came right out and took our drink orders. She was constantly picking up plates and filling up our drinks so that worked out great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food selection was varied and good. As with any buffet, nothing was amazing, but they had several fish alternatives, sushi that was made periodically throughout the day, prime rib that was cooked medium rare, salad bar, Mexican, Chinese, vegetables and a dessert bar. Plus tons more. In fact, I filled up my plate once and then saw a completely different section afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd definitely go back if I was in town again. It's a convenient, efficient, relatively inexpensive (for Mandalay Bay area) meal.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food selection is decent, the taste of the food is good enough not to complain but nothing to write home about.  Examples include only bud as a beer option, best item would be the breaded shrimp although there is a lot of breading, and the breads are about as hard as a rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is real good, quick and on par.  Deserts are definitely not up to snuff, not much selection, the yogurt melts in a few seconds.  Check it out if you are in the area, but would not make a trip just for this.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had this complimentary from staying at the hotel. Food was alright, had a lot of different varieties. We had lunch here. For the price I don't think it's worth it so I'm glad technically it was free for us. Wouldn't go back though. We did leave full just eating pretty much eating what We liked the most. Staff is as friendly and everything seemed clean. Deserts weren't the best either. Even the ice cream was bland.\n",

      "Wow.... You pay the same for the Wynn buffet, but you get So.much.LESS. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was disappointing after having eaten at other Vegas buffets... the food didn't taste fresh or anything. There wasn't anything too special or amazing. The sushi was worse than what you'd get at a grocery store. Ate one plate and stopped there... sad.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not the biggest buffet ever, but they have a good deal of seafood and it's pretty tasty. A solid 3 star here, which would be a 4 if the price was a little lower ($26 or $20 if you do the Shark exhibit, which I did)!\n",

      "We went here because we had hotel credit from a stay. We went for dinner on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy. It was $35\\/per person and the buffet was fairly large. There's a pasta bar, sushi (CA roll and salmon rolls), meat station, comfort foods, beer and wine, seafood, & Mexican station. The food was just ok but nothing spectacular. My favorite dish was the veal osso bucco & asparagus. Everything else was either really salty or lacked flavor. Service was fine but I didn't like how they sat us (party of 5) in a table for 4. I need room when I eat crab legs!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was ok, $23ish for brunch, no wait in line. Good selection of food. Decor wasn't anything to rave about, just a no frills buffet. Service wasn't great (hard to get someone's attention for drinks) but good worth worth the money and no wait.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's the perfect 3 star buffet.  I got it for free via (MyVegas Awards) so I am not complaining.  For being an awesome property, this place lacks.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's not the best but it wasn't the worst either. They do have a little bit of everything. They also do have sugar free options for dessert. I would not recommend the shrimp, took one bite and could tell that it has just been sitting there for a long while and it also didn't smell right. Overall I did enjoy my experience.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We were in Vegas for Thanksgiving and didn't feel like dropping $60 per person for the Bacchanal buffet (Thanksgiving prices), especially for a party of 12. At $30 per person, the food was not bad at all. We got there at 12 and they still had breakfast items available as well as lunch and thanksgiving lunch items as well. The food was not excellent but was pretty good and I more than had my fill. The prime rib was so tender, though a little dry, but was still pretty good. All the food was hot and I could see the staff constantly checking the food temperature to make sure all was well. There was so much to choose from but I was able to try everything I wanted. They have a good selection though probably not as much as Bacchanal or the buffet at the Bellagio, but you'll definitely get your money's worth. The staff is attentive and always making sure our drinks were filled and tables cleared. Also there was no line to get in to the buffet. Give it a try if you don't feel like waiting at the other buffets. It's actually not bad at all.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was great.  However, I had foot surgery and can't walk.  Where do you seat someone who will have to balance a plate and a walker?  Hint - there was only one table farther from a food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Won't go back until I can walk.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not worth it. Only upside is there weren't too many people there. For such a nice hotel, the food was off. They did have crabs but everything else was alright. Servers were attentive but like I said, weren't too many people. Maybe since it was a weeknight and after the holidays. I'd spend the extra few bucks and dine at Aria, The M, or Cosmo.\n"

      "The main attraction of any buffet is the prime rib, seafood, and desserts.  \"Bayside\" buffet is just average for all three.  The prime rib was overcooked and seemed like it was last night's batch. The very middle of the rib roast was well done!! I probably came at a bad time.  The seafood is pretty decent here.  The Shrimp cocktail are of a very large size compared to Wynn and Bellagio.  The king crab legs (frozen..errr chilled) were split and of decent size as well.  I wouldnt' say they were as large as the ones at Wynn but good enough to enjoy.  The problem I had was that they over salted the legs so it was a little hard to eat.  I don't know if it was done on accident or just part of the preservation chemicals used on the legs.  Moving on, desserts were pretty crappy actually.  Nothing really looked good but taking a waffle cone filled to the top with ice cream was really great for the long walk back to my car!!  Everything else served is your standard buffet, breakfast stuff, pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc.  Nothing to write home about.  I do think for $23.99 you can get max value out of the buffet by just focusing...err \"enjoying\" the more expensive foods and the drinks.\n",

      "Friends from out of town who were staying at The Hotel asked me to join them for dinner at the Bayside Buffet.  I had been here once before many years ago, and I remembered it as being a good, solid place.  It's pretty much the same now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among some of the things I tires, the Chinese broccoli with lots of garlic was outstanding.  The BBQ chicken pizza was good, too.  The prime rib was standard and was much of the other things I tried from the buffet.  There were no gourmet dishes but there was nothing that was bad.\n",
      "\n",

      "I think the place it was lacking was at the dessert area.  I ended up with two chocolate cakes and a raspberry cake.  The two raspberry and square chocolate cakes were OK but the chocolate cake cut like a pie wedge was outstanding!  It was quite rich--almost decadent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend this place for someone who's staying at Mandalay Bay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  There are better buffet options available on the Strip but at a few dollars more for the most part.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Eating at the Bayside Buffet is a \"hit-or-miss\" depending on the day and time. The last time I went, it was AMAZING. Our server was attentive, drinks always refilled and the food selection was exceptional. We had prime rib, freshly baked pizzas and extremely crispy fried chicken. After coming here numerous times, the salad bar hardly changes. I even found brown rice and whole grain pasta available (shocker, but I loved the healthy selection). Other times I went, the food was good and mostly fresh but the service was lacking. Drinks hardly got refilled and our server even walked by us and cleaned other tables not noticing that all 4 of us don't have any beverages. Another point of notice was that it wasn't even busy (defined as more than half the tables were vacant). Overall though, I love coming to Bayside Buffet. If the service was consistent, this would be one of Vegas's top buffets.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I thought it was well worth the price. The food was plentiful and good. Prime rib was delicious. You have to know what to pick from these places. The \"stuffed chicken leg\" was obviously store bought chicken cordon bleu. BBQ chicken pizza was excellent. I also like that beer, wine & champagne was included. Desserts were yummy. Overall, well worth the price. Also, if you're paying by credit card, use the self serve kiosks- HUGE time saver and super convenient.  The service was extremely attentive as well. I'd definitely return.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Buffet  $30 -packed as usual.  Nothing outstanding but something for everyone to hit the spot.  Crab legs were cold and just OK, prime rib was chewy but OK, the Chinese items were acceptable.  Sushi available, pasta available, salads, all the usual.  Had expected slightly better quality.  All the dessert we tried were delicious, and there was a sugar free choc dessert which was yum!\n",

      "The food is good. The selection is decent, not that much in comparison to some other buffets.  And they dont have many options for fresh makings by the chefs.  I went for dinner buffet and there was only the guy at the pasta place (which by the way was watery, not al dente and was bland despite the loads of sauce on it)\n",
      "And the sushi was of hard rice!! ugh.  sushi with hard rice is so gross.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like the place, but the dessert is not as good as the other buffets. The selection also leaves a lot to be desired. However, if you like crab meat, this place is excellent. There is also a shorter wait. The people who work here are fast and efficient. Very good crabs, excellent fried shrimp. Excellent short ribs. Good fried noodles. There is also a person who cooks your pasta. Overall I have a positive view.\n",

      "I was visiting the shark reef (which was fantastic) but since it was near dinner time, we decided to  hit up the buffet. There was no line, so that was nice but there's a reason for it. The food overall wasn't that great and even my baby didn't like the food either (and she's not typically a picky eater). She would not eat anything :(. I noticed the food was a little hard to chew so maybe that's why. Better to else where and pay a little more for better food and selection, like at the Wicked Spoon (cosmo).\n",

      "Will keep this short.  Back from 3 days and nights of Super Bowl  carousing in Vegas, seems like we wind up doing 2 buffets a day when I am with the guys.  We hit Bellagio, Paris and Mandalay Bay buffets.  All I can say is this one can be missed.  Two stars for the food, one star for Lena, a beautiful waitress who was the best I have ever encountered at a buffet.  Attentive to every need, kept it all moving, plates cleared, always asking what we needed, why is she even working there. I digress, skip this buffet and head for Paris buffet.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was a decent buffet but nothing spectacular.  It's very nice that there is no hour long wait in line to get in this place at any time.  Your options span the basics.  There is italian, asian, american, and mexican dining options.  They don't serve any breakfast items after 12pm which really sucks.  The prime rib was ok.  The carnitas were pretty good.  I enjoyed the fresh fruit and yogurt.  They had a very good dessert spread but I didn't try anything from it so I can't comment on how good any of it tasted.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "They seemed to have almost every type of meat that you can think of and various food genres. The specific night I was here it was american, asian, mexican, and italian. They had a sushi station setup and custom ordered pasta. The dessert bar is also quite extravagant. It was full of various pies, cake, puddings, soft serve ice cream, and cookies, both regular and sugar free. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason why I didn't give this place 4 stars was the table service was a little slow to get things like drinks and extra silverware, but it was no way impactful enough for me to not come back the next time I am here.\n"

      "This buffet...in the land of buffets....is pretty standard. Hubby and I were able to walk in and be seated fairly quickly for dinner. The dishes they had weren't bad...but nothing really stuck out either. The carved station featured both prime rib and turkey. The prime rib was a bit overdone for my tastes...but it didn't have bad flavor. The turkey was pretty good and the hubby really loves turkey. (He was deprived turkey as a kid at Thanksgiving and other holidays...as his family doesn't like it, so he goes ga-ga for turkey) They did have king crab legs as well as snow crab...I of course went for the king crab and he surprised me and went for the snow crab. The king crab legs were kind of mushy...and just not very flavorful...kind of a bummer for me. He was busy cracking away at his snow crab...and offered me a bite of it. Wow...stand out of the evening! I shamelessly ditched my sad, tasteless plate of king crab legs...and bee-lined it to the snow crab. So sweet, so flavorful...really melt in your mouth goodness in a shell. After indulging in more snow crab than I probably should have, we perused the dessert section. They offered a ton of items including sugar free items...sadly nothing was remarkable. \n",
      "Service was kind of a miss for us that night. At first the hubby ordered pineapple juice and water...he got his water.....and it took 3 times of us asking for the pineapple juice before it finally arrived. I sat with empty water and soda for a while...but we noticed our poor server had the party from hell...(20 top.....with 15 kids) So we definitely cut him major slack for that and once we got refills and the pineapple juice the service kind of picked up...plates removed promptly enough given the circumstance. All in all it was just \"a-ok\" with only a few dishes being good-great and the rest kind of ....in the middle. I don't think we would return to this buffet only because the vast amount of food in Vegas...but it was cheap eats and a nice time with my guy.\n",

The deserts were sub par and the service was just ok. I would return for breakfast and that's about it.\n",

The other items were a bit hit-or-miss, but over all a great deal ($23.00 for a champagne Sunday brunch).\n",

Our server brought our drinks out right away and was very friendly. The food was pretty standard but nothing was bad either. The layout was very strange though. For example, the entrees were not marked correctly and they had breakfast and lunch mixed together. Scrambled eggs were next to meat balls and I was so confused. The french toast, bacon, and fruit were great and I was left feeling full and satisfied so that's all that matters. Was it outstanding? No but it wasn't bad by any means.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I usually never go to buffets in Vegas however we got comped the buffet at the Mandalay so we basically had to go here. The food is mediocre. They also basically false advertise the prime rib. They don't always have prime rib, the day we went they had something called steamship. I had never heard of this cut of meat before but me as a surgical anatomist and an aspiring butcher I looked into it. Steamship is the top round cut of meat with the femur bone included. This is a lean, cheap primal cut of meat. This is very very different than prime rib. It still tasted good but it is not prime rib. The crab legs were salty and scrawny. Overall disappointing however most buffets disappoint me anyways.\n",

      "There is a great selection here.  Decent carving station, asian foods, pasta cooking station, and salads.  I really liked the corn chowder here.  It was creamy and sweet-you could really taste the corn which I really enjoyed.  I mainly had a lot of veggies here bc I was overdosing on meat the entire weekend.  I liked the bak choy in the asian station, and the green beans & tomatoes were a nice side with my breaded chicken & cheese dish.  What I liked was the pasta cooking station.  I had bow tie pasta, with shrimp, onions, mushrooms, with a combination of their alfredo sauce & tomato sauce, topped off with fresh tomatoes.  This was actually pretty good and I couldve eaten the whole bowl had it not been one of the last things I went for.  Meat was OK.  Liked their rotisserie chicken & grilled steak.\n",

We ate fish, snow crab legs, warm and cold; shrimp cocktail; prime rib; make your own pasta; Mexican food; tons of different options.

It has a smoky flavor that is unmatched. Try it topped with hoisin sauce and you could make a delicious meal out of just that. Otherwise, the MORE Buffet at Luxor is much better for variety and taste of food than this place. Generally, the food here is pretty generic. I admit I just go for the convenience when staying at Mandalay Bay...and that pork fried rice!  Plus the service here is always friendly and efficient bringing our drinks and removing used plates.\n",

If you want a top tier, 5 star buffet you can have one at the Cosmopolitan or Bellagio, but that's not what you're paying for here. I thought their brunch buffet was reasonably priced for the selection. I believe it was $64 with a 15% tip added. They had crab legs which were decent. Not all of the food was amazing, but again, it's about what I expected. Come here with mid range expectations and you'll be fine.\n",

      "2. The prime rib was exactly that, prime rib. No need for sauce, or any condiments. It was great as is. Awesome flavor.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",

      "We at here twice during our week-long stay; once for brunch and once for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brunch - The brunch was pretty standard. Bacon, eggs, omelet station, waffles, pancakes, french toast, the usual suspects. It was pretty standard and nothing to write home about. I think they could consider two omelet stations though, the line gets pretty long and I didn't want to wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner - I felt this left a lot to be desired. The highlights include their version of cioppino, which had three different kinds of shrimp and imitation crab meat. The tomato broth was amazing. They also had snow crab legs, which if you take the time to add some of that to the cioppino, brings it up a level (but makes it colder). The low-lights were the prime rib, which was brown and way over done. The flank steak was tough and not flavorful. The pasta station didn't make any sense and didn't tell you what the options were. All of the bread\\/rolls were hard. Even the desserts were just ok. Their tiramisu was made it cute little chocolate cups but the lady fingers were soaked and soggy from the coffee at the bottom. \n",

Traditional breakfast things like eggs, french toast, breads, fruit dishes, & oatmeal can be found in abundance. They also had a number of seafood options including crab, sushi, and one other white fish which I thought was particularly unpleasant. There are also plenty of options in terms of desserts. The little tiramisu cups are a favorite. I was happy these seemed to be ubiquitous in Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere is fun. I was particularly happy that this restaurant wasn't outfitted with a superfluous amount of gaudy flourishes or decorations. It was simple and to the point while still fitting with the resort-style feel of Mandalay Bay. \n",

For example, the potstickers were as expected but the rice dough was slightly too thick and they had been sitting awhile.\n",

Actually, that's a lie.  Their COOKIES-- mmmmmm... They're big and soft and oh so divine.  The white chocolate cherry is my favorite (whispers: I took some home).\n",

While there were a lot of choices, the taste of food wasn't the best. There were a lot of things that looked good, but just weren't satisfying. I would however take advantage of the bottomless champagne on the weekends. The servers are very good about topping off your glasses so you get your money's worth. I would recommend this buffet over a regular casino restaurant because it costs the same but you get more food.\n",

I'm glad that it was a comped buffet, or I'd have been extremely dissapointed.\n",

Not one of the top buffets but not the worst either I've ever had. Went there for a quick dinner on a Friday night after tearing down a trade show booth. Just walked in and was seated immediacy and was given good service. Food was for the most part fresh and plentiful.\n",

I had to serve myself and get the straws from another waitress.  The food was spread in 2 sections for breakfast. The 2 areas were similar by 75% with the same foods and differed by 25% with a different in choices. Meaning while both sides had eggs, waffles, and pancakes.

Fresh made to order omelets in the morning and of course, prime rib at night. The wait staff was very friendly and kept our table clear of dirty dishes. Pretty good variety of food to choose from but was surprised they didn't have my favorite french dressing for salads. Other than that, my only other complaint was the prime rib being extremely too rare for my taste. The quality of the food was fairly decent, and the ambiance was pleasant.

So I waited at my table for my drink order and a woman comes up tells me her name and literally throws my straw at me and asks me if i wanted a drink. She seemed to very irritated. I sat there shocked and I noticed that a couple sitting in a table across stared and sat their open mouthed shocked as well by how rude she was. I asked for a Pepsi and she went on her way. After she left the woman from the other table said \"well I guess you are going to get the same service as us.\" Apparently she was rude to them too. Honestly, I could care less after i got my drink. I thought i did not really need her for anything else. As i went to help myself to the food I saw there was quite a variety of different foods. They had Mexican, Spanish, Asian, Italian, salad, soups, prime rib, and best of all crab legs! of course I made a beeline for the crab legs. I grabbed some and some salad for my first place. The crab legs were great! The meat was tender and good. I was trying to crack the legs myself by breaking them in half with my hands when my lovely waitress ran by and dropped a crab leg cracker at my table. After that she was totally different toward me. So attentive and nice. It was like a different person. I don;t know, my guess is because I did not really ask her for anything but a drink in the beginning? Don;t really know. But when I went for a second plate I helped myself to more crab legs and some fried rice and a pizza slice. The pizza was ok and the fried rice was gross. I really liked the crab legs though. now for dessert. I went and grabbed some butterscotch cookies that just looked good and they were the best cookies I have ever eaten. I eve took some with me! LOL. I know that is bad but they were that good. The ice cream sucked. Honestly by the time I left I was more than satisfied with the crab legs and butterscotch cookies. \n",

      "Second Visit:\n",
      "Much longer line this time probably cause it was Christmas. I don't know I wanted to try the prime rib this time so I decided to go back on whim. Having more butterscotch cookies as a holiday treat could not hurt either. The line was long but once I got in and seated it wasn't bad. Got my drink pretty quickly. Went and grabbed some prime rib and crab legs first. The prime rib was just ok, Nothing to write home about, I grabbed more crab legs and after that went for the butterscotch cookies. They were just as amazing as last time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, with the exception of the crab legs and butterscotch cookies everything was either looked kinda gross or was gross. I don't think I would advise someone to spend $30 just to try a couple of things. Go for it if you want to. I might go back I might not. I mean the crab legs suffice as a good meal for me.\n",

Since I'm in LA I go to Redondo pier to get my steamed Dungeness crab claws :)\n",

      "Wonderful burgers,  excellent onion rings, good service.  Just don't order dessert.  We ordered apple cobbler and was served blueberry bread pudding.  When we questioned if it was apple cobbler our waited assured us it was cobbler. After we ate a few bites... no apple! The waitress told us she has been waiting for a customer to question it.  We still were charged the full $7.00 for a dessert we didn't order or want! Too bad the rest of the meal was great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Visited for Restaurant Week so we had a shared app (crab cake), two entrees (Carolina burger w\\/string fries and fish and \"chips\"\\/string fries) and shared dessert. The waiter was friendly but somewhat unattentive and tried to push the other restaurants\\/deli on to us quite a bit. The food was pretty mediocre but edible..no complaints. I'm not a huge string fry fan so I was hoping for some thicker cut \"chips\". The blueberry bread pudding was okay. It tasted like they used old garlic bread from the other restaurant next door then smothered it in whiskey and butter. We went about 15-20 minutes without a water refill and waited 10 minutes for our card to be picked up. All in all it was just okay but at least now we know and it only cost us $30. I guess that's what Restaurant Week is all about though right?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Was here on a business lunch with a colleague.  I had the Arizona burger.  The bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger, and while good in theory, was ok at best.  Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.\n",

      "On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.\n",

      "If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion.\n"

I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich and on this trip I had the Carolina burger. The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars. \n",

      "My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here.\n",

      "The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud. \n",

I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up. \n",

I didn't get southwest and I did get blah\\/lacking in flavor. \n",

      "Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.\n",
      "\n",

      "Easy location. I only wish they were open and delivered at lunch time. The food is very good. I had the 5 cheese sandwich, a cheese lovers dream, and the housemade onion rings. I had ordered a diet coke which was flat. They could not fix it, so I just drank water. The wait staff was friendly, but kind of slow. I thought it was very, very pricey for what you get. The food was very good. I guess it comes down to what are you tradeoffs for good food?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Service good. Atmosphere good. Burgers...to die for. Shrimp Po Boy, overlooked and plain.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was okay... First off, this place is in a strip mall - not the kind of place you expect to be asked \"do you have reservations?\" I think there is a little mismatch here. The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams \"American Bistro\" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local\\/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not \"the check\"), we got everyone's tab on it! WHat a nightmare. The server, who had been inattentive or disorganized all night never got better (hint: you will improve your tips if you don't call the men \"buddy\" and \"bro\" and if you don't call the women \"sweetie.\" Frankly, \"Sir\" and \"Ma'am\" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and \"truffle fries?\" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger.\n",
      "I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good.\n",
      "Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nicholas my subordinate from work suggested that we should try this place because it looked cool.  So we jump into the car and drove a bazillion miles to get here. \n",

      "The place definitely looked cool in person and it was well kept and clean.  The loo was pretty decent as well for a burger joint.  The staff were super friendly and helpful because this was our first time eating here.  Service was good speed, and no mistakes were made. \n",
      "\n",
      "To the food, Nicholas order their signature burger, and we split their mac and cheese... which was absolutely amazing! It's definitely not the best I had, but close enough.. and I highly recommend it.  I also order some wings which was okay, they were really tough to chew. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a good place.  Probably won't come back again since it's so very far.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not so much a review, but a chance to vent about about the negative experience we just had at Charr. The hamburgers are great and they have the best onion rings I've ever tasted. No complaints about the service.\n",
      "Nonetheless, our meal tonight was very uncomfortable. The owner paid for our meal and told us not to come back. \n",
      "The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, \"So you don't make exceptions.\" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, \"Don't come back.\" \n",
      "Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, \"sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good. \n",
      "The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.)\n",
      "I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business.\n"

We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek..\n",

This time I ordered a burger and she got steak sandwich, we both ordered medium rare...I thought that means pink in the middle...well, they both came out well done. Granted they tasted fine, but when you prefer your meat cooked a certain way, you'd hope it is. If you order, order well below how you like your meat, it will likely come out more done then expected.

We had 2 wedge salads, 2 burgers, an order of onion rings and 3 beers.  $60.  In the next two weeks we went to a nearby sports bar\\/Italian place and a brewpub.  For similar quantities, the price was $35 at one place and $38 at the other, both similar quality.  I have a hard time justifying the higher price tag, especially considering how loud it was at Charr, it was difficult to have a conversation.  The beer selection is good, but overpriced as was the case with everything.  Doing a la carte will be a tough sell when that is not what everyone else does.  We may return but not often unless the value gets better.  I wish them well but would encourage them to consider some changes that will price them more competitively.\n",

A brand new server who was slow and inefficient was irritating, but the real sin was over cooking the burgers. 4 people at the table ordered medium and 1 was served medium and 3 well done.  I assume the beef was as high quality as everything else, but I had no way to tell with meat that over cooked.\n",

This most recent visit, the hostess seated us and I asked for a reminder on what the WiFi password was (I'm not a total douche...my wife and I run a small biz together and commonly work over meals and drinks).  The hostess kinda curtly said she didn't know if the place even has WiFi (I knew it did) and didn't know the password if it did.   No effort to go get it.  Finally waited for a server, who vaguely thought she knew it.  I'm not in the HRM industry, except as a consumer, but I can't imagine not training my staff on this.  Love the ambiance and food.

The buns are actually garlic knots or something similar, but they are shaped like cinnabons in which the dough is spiraled all the way to the center. Unique fun idea but man, does this make for a horribly messy burger. You are forced to gobble up the burgers very quickly so they don't fall apart on you. The pizza burger was good, but I liked the chili one more just because there was more flavor to it. It's not that spicy either, so if you're afraid of spice, you are safe to order this chili one. \n",

The place is alot more trendy and fun in comparison to the rustic, yet charming older restaurant on Central Avenue close to Camelback. I'm hoping for this place to be a success, but I feel like there are a few more \"things\" that need to be worked out. Even if their burgers are just okay to most people it seems (after reading several previous reviews), let me assure you that their regular Italian food is their specialty and what they're amazing at!\n"

      "We ordered the American Turkey burger, Charr Burger with cheese, and the kid's meal chicken fingers. We thought the turkey burger was a bit on the dry side. It comes with a garlic aioli, which was flavorful, but there was a lot of it! The cheeseburger was ordered medium, and was more medium-well. It was good, though. The little one loved the chicken fingers and all of us devoured the truffle fries!\n",

      "The Town Square shopping center is a pretty interesting place because the mix of shops & activities is good for locals & tourists.  The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "There is bowling here. It's not bad, enough space for the families to sit around and hang out. The downfall, there was no one working at the bar within the bowling area. Made it difficult for everyone to look after their belongings and children while ordering food and drinks. lol. Enjoy the ugly neon shoes.  \n",

      "We walk in and meet a nice lady where we buy the card with credits. First game we play and it takes our 9 credits and doesn't work. Well that was great. Credits do cost money it's not like we were on some play for so many hours thing. Things were pretty cool from there until we got to the giant fish reel. The reel says we won 70 tickets awesome, the box even says we were awarded 70. So of course since 70 is a lot lets play again. This time the giant reel says we won 60 tickets! Child is super excited and I look down at the box and it says 15 tickets awarded. WHAT?! So I got robbed of 9 credits and at least 45 tickets. Never thought to watch any of the other times we won tickets so who knows how many Game Works really stole from us. It was over all a good time, just left a bad feeling knowing we got ripped off.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had lots of fun here And I truly felt like a kid again! The things that bugged me is that it is very pricey and the tickets compared to the prizes is very expensive! Something I can purchase at the store for maybe $10 cost 1000 tickets or maybe $50 of hard work gaining the tickets. So with that being said if you are in it for the fun and ready to spend lots of money then have at it! The service though was great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "You can go through $100 here in no time, the game prices are very high but the place is a lot of fun and the kids love it. Being in a wheelchair the accessibility is not bad at all. I just wish I could transfer into the games with seating easier. Overall a fun higher priced experience for the family.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a nice addition to Town Square but VERY pricey.  Not enough actual arcade games. And some are already broken or not working yet. Bar and restaurant area is too big, takes up half of the place. Bowling is $5 per game and $4 for shoes. Needs a lot of work to get out all the kinks to make this a great local spot.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Smaller than expected it to be. Not really wowed. There was a bar, which is a plus. But for a Saturday night.. The bar was completely understaffed. This is probably the longest I had to wait for a drink. Which made me a little irritated. Pricing was not bad compared to other places on the strip. Decor is very nice... But they need to staff accordingly!!!!! Not as many games as the previous GAMEWORKS in Vegas. The bathrooms were a little dirty as well. I would come back to see if this would change.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The kids wanted to meet up and hang out with some of their friends so this is place they chose. The games could use some updating, but the air hockey table was where they spent most of there time! This was not your average air hockey table. This was air hockey on steroids. At different times like 20 small pucks would slide down on the table and it was a blast seeing the kids faces light up with excitement! \n",
      "We got here a bit late so we didn't get to try the food, but looking at the pics on Yelp, I may just go back for lunch before we leave Vegas. The bar looked pretty cool as well had 2 pool tables in back, but I was with my kids and holding my littlest man man so no adult activities for daddy. Another cool thing about this place is they had a section with some of the classics, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, just to name a few. All and all the kids had a blast even little guy fun on some riding games.\n",

      "Pretty cool spot for a night out with friends or a day with the family. There are tons of games, bowling, food and drinks (for the adults ). We have been here a few times and each time of course the kids left very happy (and tired, thankfully). They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer\\/video games. Games for everyone! \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!! \n",

      "Located in Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd, just South of the Famous Las Vegas Strip. This is an arcade for kids and adults alike. It looks like a great place to throw a party. Although the food is ok, just ok, I had the pizza, it was about the same price as one you could get at CPK, and not nearly as good. But still a fun place and they have a decent happy hour. So I say stop in and try your hand at ski ball. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!\n",

      "\n",
      "I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.\n",

When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gameworks. When you hear that it should sound like a dream to everyone. The former Gamewirks that was on the Strip was a wonderful attraction. It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new \"Recharge Center\" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The new town square location is convenient. I came for Sunday football and met up with some friends, some of whom have children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each game was prominently displayed. There are not only big flat screens but projector tv's as well. Plus, audio for one game was playing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot speak to the bowling or the LAN\\/internet gaming, but the former was empty and the later seemed packed.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I want to give this a five star rating based on the games but I can't since their food is awful! I got very sick after eating their nachos. 7\\/11 has better nachos then here. My husband ordered the wings. They were over cooked and were frozen before being cooked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Paid $4.00 for a fountain soda! Can you say way over priced! I recommend only playing the games they have .. However they need more current ones. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I chuckled when I saw that this place is categorized on Yelp under \"Gastropubs.\" That's pretty generous.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that's always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as \"ground steak\" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13\\/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16\") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine.\n",

      "The first few games we tried had broken controls so we played more of the circus games that you can win tickets to redeem for little trinkets. Those brought back memories of going to the carnival when I was little. My teenage son  decided to go the gaming section which features online computer role playing. the price at 5 per hour seemed very reasonable.  Decided to have lunch at the restaurant. It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people. \n",

      "First time in a long time since I came back to Gameworks. The last time I've been here was when they had one on the strip next to M&M World.  I've seen nothing new except the bowling and they have billards.  It looked similar to Insert Coins.  Because they have a bar and gaming consoles for you to play on too.  I didn't like the new payment method where you have to get a prepaid card to swipe to play a game.  I like the old fashion pay with quarters.  I like they have an internet cafe where you can LAN party with your friends.  All in all, it's not that bad.\n"

      "GameWorks is still the same GameWorks that was on the Strip. The prices are high, the games race car and shooter centric. The kids had a blast running around and playing the games. The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad.\n",

      "Come here on a weekday! It's a lot less crowded and the service is a bit better. We decided to take my niece and nephew here on a Saturday night and it was really packed. We wanted to get the unlimited game card but you have to dine in to get the deal. I really wish they would just sell the cards without meals coz we didn't really want to eat there. We had to so we did. We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper. She took our name down and our number and said they'll call when a table was ready. So we walk around outside for a bit and when the 30 minutes was up we came back and checked in with the hostess. We waited another 10 minutes then we were finally sat. It seemed like they were short on people. We were sat for quite a bit when a manager finally took our order. The food was ok. We got the nachos and pizza. After that whole process, we finally got our game cards so the kids could play. Nearly all the machines and games were in use. You kind of had to stand by the game you wanted to play and wait for whoever was using it to finish so you can play it next for sure. There was a good selection of games for the small space. I think the kids had fun in the end but they were miserable having to wait for the restaurant and the food and that whole process of getting the game card.\n",

We were rarely checked on in the few hours there. We didn't get the bill until we asked for it. As infrequently as we got serviced, the waitress is lucky we are honest people! \n",

After 10 minutes I realized they would be out of money real quick SO I inquired on the food and play option ($15 for an hour with one food item or $22 for 2 hrs and one food item) . You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn't just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour\\/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect \"tickets\" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food. \n",

My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "While this is a more convenient location than the original Game Works it does somewhat lack the content and size of the strip location. I can't help but compare any venue of the type to Dave & Busters of which there is no comparison. We came for Birthday party, they did do a good job and our server Mike was outstanding. But $11 for six slices of pizza is a bit much as we had to buy over six pizzas to feed 10 hungry teens. Buy the size of the crowd its nice to see Game Works doing well but they could reduce the dinning area to accommodate more gaming space as it was only half full at best on a Saturday night. Overall we had good time.\n",

      "Now, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~! \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!\n",

      "So always been fan of the concept of GameWorks since I visited one in Seattle years ago. The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar\\/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good. \n",
      "\n",
      "If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks.\n"

What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards. \n",

      "I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all. \n",
      "\n",
      "BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more \"prizes\" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered\\/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn't mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket. \n",

      "I did a quick restroom trip, it seemed clean enough-there is also a gender neutral restroom for families. I spied a bowling alley, a couple pool tables, a private party room, and a bar. Cool place to bring the entire family.\n",

      "\n",
      "I used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. \n",
      "\n",
      "They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Centipede\", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most \"little\" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play \"Call of Duty\" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by \"Barcade\" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, \"One Moscow Mule please\". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gameworks seems too crowded. Every machine was Taken, so you practically have to fall in line for every game. We went on a Saturday afternoon\\/evening time. During the week it's probably much less busy so at least one game could be playable without having to wait. Had a done in and the service was quick and delicious. No problems with that.\n",
      "And I felt that there were too many racing games. Not enough 4 player games or FPS. Nice location, great atmosphere.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Cons. Kinda pricey , limited floor space for the games. The restaurant area looks incredibly mundane and bland. I honestly think whoever designed this place was having a indentity crisis . I just feel like they don't know what they wanna be. \n",

      "Now, the arcade portion isn't the best or the worst; there are enough cool games to go around, some classics and a few epic gaming machines.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The location is better, away from the strip. It is a lot smaller from the old Gameworks. The games are great and up to date. Durning the weekend there is a ton of families. But it's a giant arcade so I can't complain. Overall it's okay place and the price is reasonable.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Guess this place just has a fun play around vibe. I'm comparing it to a place I used to go to that had games & food but was a hot spot to hang out at night! Took my 10 year old boy cousin and he had a LOT of fun!! From racing\\/shooting games to the ticket games! But the prizes were kinda ticketed too high for what my cousin could get on $20. Maybe kinda lower some of the prize ticket amounts an it would be good for the kids to want to come back. But this time around..was good! \n",
      "Went on a Thursday night. It was in the summer so it was very full with both kids and adults having fun. But my experience wasn't anything to brag about. I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were \"out of service\". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design. Very poor as a game fun center..didn't make it fun! Boo..bring a dave n busters!!!!!!!!\n"

      "I can't give an all too extensive review because we were mostly secluded in the billiards area of the main bar (by the entry way). It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for \"The Color of Money\" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we'd have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an 'okay' experience for a limited one.\n",

      "Being a gamer I had to check out this place. I've never been to the original GameWorks, but this place wasn't as bad as I had expected. My gf and I stopped by here to check out some of the old arcade and VR games. The prices are bit high for the games and drinks are pricey as well. Overall its a place to check out once.\n",

      "It's nice to see Gameworks back in Vegas, since I remember going to the old location on the strip. By comparison,  this new location is a ton newer but also smaller. It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!\n",
      "\n",
      "The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.\n",

      "There are way too many ticket machines which require no skill and attract little kids to use up all their quarters! I wish all the games gave tickets so they would actually play games besides ticket machines! A lot of machines were out of order. There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds. No matter how the adults feel, this is heaven for kids!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "This was the latest of several trips here with our 3 boys while visiting Vegas. Again it was great entertainment for the kids. However I was frustrated by the many machines that were not working at all or in desperate need of repair. I was recently at a Dave and Busters where the games were newer and in better shape. Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Honestly every time I go here the games are always broken and take my credits. It makes me sad. I also feel that the games take way too many credits to play especially for them to be broken. I always think \"hey lets go to gameworks\" and then I realize how bad it is everytime hahaha. Granted I hate chuck e cheese but it's way better as far as games go it also feels more liberating with actual tickets in your hand. I do prefer the people at gameworks VS chuck e cheese because it's flooded with little kids. Anyways Gameworks is ok... I guess lol\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great place for kid's parties. I recently attended one, where the family rented out a large room that had plenty of space for guests and tables full of pizza, wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and bruchetta. The food wasn't anything special, but that's to be expected from a place that focuses on games and entertainment. The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times.\n",

      "Games: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.\n",

      "Overall, not too bad but still feels like they are missing something.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great place for kids of all ages to play a wide variety of arcade games, ranging from high-end video games (sit inside of a capsule, with wrap-around screens) right down to those silly games you find at other venues that spit out paper tickets you can redeem for nearly worthless prizes.  Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat.\n"

I ended up wasting 20 bucks playing low quality and overrated games for little kids. I was more interested into the eSports games, which is near the back of Gameworks. eSports interests Pre-Teens and up. eSports has a Wii U for Smash Bros and Mario Kart 8, XBox for Mortal Kombat X and Minecraft, PS4 for Call of Duty or Counter Strike Global Offensive, and a computer that can download any playable game for free.

Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.\n",

      "Onward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My expectation for gameworks is that the games actually work. We opted for an hour unlimited play, which we understood that we wouldn't be getting tickets and about 12 machines that weren't valid with our pass. However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones. We still had fun with the ones that still worked, but I was pretty disappointed. They also have a bar here with reasonable prices along with a menu for food too.\n",

Their breakfast options are okay - wish the toast would be crispier. The service is better this time, at least our waitress did not get our drinks or our food orders wrong. Gneerally some of their staff needs to improve on their attitudes towards their customers. I get that it's a SUnday afternoon and you are busy, but there is no need to roll your eyes at your customers, especially when we as a large group already agreed to splitting up in order for her to seat us easier (yes i'm talking about the hostess).

The prices are cheap here and food is ok, not great, but you really can't expect much for the price you pay. They offer lots of dim sum choices too but why get frozen dim sum from here, when you can buy some from T & T and steam it yourself. \n",

      "A traditional HK cafe-style restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is quite relaxing.  Lots of open space and comfortable seating.  My family and I went at around 7 PM and there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated fairly quickly.  The menu offers a variety of choices, from individual items to set meals for larger groups.  They also have lunch and dinner specials for a good price.  I was excited to see an all-day breakfast section (because come on, it's never the wrong time for sausage and eggs), but that quickly changed when I realized that there were only two items in that section.  What a tease.  \n",

I was most excited for the fried rice, but it ended up being pretty bland and overall disappointing.  The curry was tasty, but I didn't have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent.  The other noodle dishes were good, but nothing amazing.  We ended off the meal with a dessert of green bean soup, which was quite tasty.\n",

If the fact that it's owned by the guy who owns Ming's (another popular HK cafe south of Pacific mall) doesn't peak your interest, then maybe the thousands of dollars of expensive iron man figures will? No? Well let's talk about the food: it's typical hk style level. I tried two breakfast specials for the sake of this review - luncheon meat instant noodles and corn beef egg sandwich with oatmeal. Both are average in taste and portions. But for $6 each what do you expect? Fast, efficient, service with economical typical dishes.

At the end of our meal, we were waiting for our desserts, but we were told they only have dessert at dinner, but we had called about this meal and they said they're able to serve it at lunch and no where in the advertisement did it say dinner only. We were given some sort of kids' mango yoghurt dessert as a replacement, better than nothing I guess.\n",

      "I am however, a bit confused as to what kind of restaurant to classify this, because my family had a 5-course Peking duck meal, something you usually get from a Chinese restaurant, but most of the menu, and the decor suggests a Hong Kong style cafe. Confusion aside, there's an array of items on the menu that will probably take you long to decide. Variety is the spice of life and if you're with a group of people who can't decide on one kind of food to eat, this would be great place to take them.\n",

      "It is all about market positioning.  In my opinion, when a restaurateur aims at a certain market, whether the restaurant is good depends on whether it delivers delicious food in a hygienic environment, and fulfils the expectation\\/norm of that market.  If it exceeds expectation, great, but IMO, \"good\" only requires meeting expectation.  Maybe my expectation of a HK cafe is not particularly demanding.  Maybe I have missed the poorly reviewed period of the grand opening.  During the first visit recently (in 2016), I find Kitchen M meeting expectation of a HK cafe..  The food is flavourful, the portion is satisfying, the pricing is on par with market, the value is sufficient, the ambiance is pleasant, the staff is efficient.  Kitchen M is great for lunch and a value dinner.  The food isn't so good that it could demand high prices, and Kitchen M doesn't charges high prices.  Here you go: it is A-OK.\n",

Crust is salted, a little bit too much so, but a little salt did make eating pizza bones enjoyable.\n",

      "Fritto Misto; fried calamari, fennel, shrimp, and zuchinnis, this dish was an overal 3.5\\/5.  I found that there was a lot of batter on it, but nonetheless there was flavor in this dish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mains we had their Fiorentina pizza which came with a shareable caesar salad.  We both came to an agreement the pizza was good, but not overly impressive, as the distribution of ingredients on the pizza was off. The salad was good, just wished they put more cheese...again its a personal thing. Overall rating for this dish was approximately 3\\/5\n",
      "\n",
      "For drinks I had their chianti classico :) nom nom....\n",
      "Would I come back, yes to try something different...........\n",

      "Great Italian food. Loved their Lobster Pizza. Nice elegant restaurant. Great for luncheon meetings for business and pleasure...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My little LOVES the kids Mac and cheese. I've tasted it and it's yummy. Wish they had an adult bowl. I recently tried the teriyaki bowl. My new favorite meal.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is the 3rd  version of the Springs Cafe that I know of, and its still about the same.  To be honest, the location and the view get the 4 stars, the food probably warrants about 3.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dining choices are good, and I've never had bad food or bad service, but there is nothing terribly special about the offerings. A solid burger, good wraps, good pizzas, some interesting specials. Again, the food takes second place to the location.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area, the views of the valley are great. Sit out on the balcony on a warm day an just take it all it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Another quality Happy Hour location in Vegas that I somehow came across. Only on Thursdays, from 4:00-8:00, they offer some great drink specials including $4 beers and $6 wines. The food isn't anything more than pub fare but it gets the job done. Live music and great views make for a nice evening. And the crowd was pretty small so you had the pick of the tables for sure. Definitely worth a trip on HH Thursdays. A nice change from your typical pub early evening out and a great way to begin Thirsty Thursday.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We're pretty pleased w\\/ Divine Cafe.  We've been coming out for lunch fairly regularly after spending the day at Spring's Preserve with our toddler son.  Lately I've been hooked on their  Angus burger, its loaded w\\/ your choice of cheese, 2 thick slices of bacon along w\\/ lettuce & tomato.  Its pretty filling plus all their sandwiches come w\\/ french fries, sweet potato tots or chips.  My hubby likes their turkey wrap and my son loves their kid's cheese pizza, it comes out piping hot so be careful w\\/ your lil ones.  Our total this afternoon, w\\/ our 10% member discount came to ~$27 including 2 Honest Teas and a kids drink, which comes w\\/ the kid's meal.  For fast casual the food is pretty darn good and priced very reasonably.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Most of us have gone to a theme park and been greatly disappointed by the food services.  Usually prepackaged, microwaved fare or fast food level, or super pricey)   Even the great San Diego Zoo has mediocre food for the most part (although if you search they do have some gems).  So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the Springs Cafe which offers well prepared, gourmet style lunches and entrees at reasonable prices.  I had a ceviche salad that was excellent.  The hamburgers were great and the sides excellent.  The sundays were tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't a gourmet location though and the service is underwhelming, the ambiance mediocre. In fact the service was very poor, they tried to bring our deserts (we got free sundays with the coupon on the flyer) at the same time as the meal. Then when we got them to understand we wanted them to wait on delivery, they got mixed up as to how many we ordered.  Also the food takes a while.  But the food is worth it and even the picky eaters I was with enjoyed their meal without complaints, not an easy task.\n"

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent.  My husband and I shared a wood fired pizza special.  It was the BBQ chicken and normally I don't like BBQ Pizzas as they are normally drowned in BBQ sauce.  This was delicate, cooked perfectly and had amazing smokey flavor.  It honestly was just perfect.  The view from the deck overlooking LasVegas was the final touch.  I will be back in a few weeks for work and will becoming by here for a nice lunch.  \n",

      "Note that the cafe can be entered without paying admission to the Preserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "We split a vegan burger, which they thoughtfully cut in two and served on two plates with tomato, lettuce, 2 pickle spears, french fries,and a scoop each of quinoa salad. When we requested hot sauce our waiter brought two different kinds, then brought a grilled jalapeno pepper to boot! The manager stopped by to ask about our experience. We were among the earlier customers the day we went; lunch crowd was only starting to come in.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The prices are a little high for the size of the food you get. For example I bought a turkey wrap  (cut into 3 small slices) for $8.50. & a small kids pizza that my kids shared for $5. + $3 for a refillable drink. I really expected bigger, but overall the taste quality wise was good. My wrap was delicious with a hint of spice and red peppers. + fries. We sat on the balcony & ate & it was a nice experience. I will be back. =)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love this slice of paradise in the middle of the desert. It serves great, fresh food, along with a few beer choices. We ordered the Monte Cristo, Portallo mushroom panini with a side of broccoli cheddar soup, and the BBQ chicken salad. The spin on the Monte Cristo resembled a breakfast French toast with ham. Very good. The panini has a nice helping of provolone for the cheese lovers! That, with the mushroom and grilled zucchini and bell peppers... nom, nom, so good! Also, has outside seating overlooking the springs and a strip view.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here is tasty and well prepared, a relief with kids in tow.  Just not that many items on their menu.  I say this because I expect overpriced pre-packaged food from museum cafes.  However, it seems to be very well run with a manager who oversees the preparation of the food.  The menu is simple and the staff very friendly.  I love the view from this location of the preserves, as well as, the Strip, most specifically you can see the Stratosphere.  I forget I'm in Vegas!  For what you get, the food is great. Don't hesitate coming here if you're visiting the Spring Preserves.  Of course the prices will be inflated but they're not outrageous.\n",

      "My friend and I arrived at 10:00am -- I believe we were the first ones to arrive. The staff, including those that I could see working in the open kitchen all appeared to be happy and in wonderful moods. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered The Burger (cooked medium) with French Fries and The Portabella Burger (vegetarian) with a Salad.  And because the morning was nothing short of perfection, we sat outside on the veranda -- the outdoor seating area is large, overlooks the preserve, and has a fabulous view of the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Burger is fantastic. The bread is soft, toasted, and buttery. The bacon is thick and crispy. The meat is of quality and was cooked perfectly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback: Serving the fries in a bucket is cute, but it causes them to be less crispy. Next time, I'd ask to have them served directly on the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Portabella Burger is fantastic as well. In place of a beef patty, the \"burger\" patty is actually a large portabella mushroom.  With the addition of marinated roasted peppers and hummus, this dish has a Mediterranean vibe about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feedback:  I would have liked a bit more hummus and the salad to have been a tad more substantial, it was a bit skimpy.\n",

      "COFFEE  $3.00\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A great place to enjoy a bite to eat while visiting the Springs Preserve or just looking for a new hangout. The food is super (burgers are huge!) and the staff is very attentive. Prices are surprisingly low.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yelpers, you should bookmark this place.  The Divine Cafe only has one happy hour and it's on Thursdays from 4-8PM.  The restaurant is separate from the Preserve so you don't need a museum or parking ticket.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The cafe\\/venue itself deserves 5 stars all on its own because it is very large and can accommodate large parties, families, or intimate dates inside OR outside.  Outdoor seating would be my preference because it provides a panoramic view of Las Vegas.  You can see downtown as well as the Strip.  However, the indoors gives off a rustic vibe with doors and windows that still have access to that beautiful view.  There's also live music inside which, in my opinion, is uncommon in this city.  For all those reasons, this place is worth a visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their happy hour menu is very limited, but has just enough variety.  They have their own cocktail drinks, a nice selection of bottled beers, and wine.  I was most impressed by the food portions.  We ordered nachos, calamari, and the date flatbread.  I thought they would be tapas style, and boy was I wrong.  The portions were very generous, and for the price, they're almost a steal considering the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Food was great, but my favorite was the bacon and date flatbread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give this place a go... I doubt it will disappoint.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I haven't been here in a couple years since it was Wolfgang Puck's restaurant and even though it was good, it was pricey for what I wanted. I noticed this time around, it changed names and it took some convincing from my hungry boyfriend to just eat here while on our Springs Preserve date than venture off campus. That being said:\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the chicken pesto pizza $10 and a burger (boyfriend never mentioned the name) $9-10 ordered medium rare. The views are beautiful and so relaxing with their floor to ceiling windows overlooking Springs Preserve and the Vegas skyline from the northwestern perspective. Food didn't take long and they brought it to the table. My pizza was definitely not just a personal size. It's good enough for two super hungry people or three people snacking. DELICIOUS. The oils from the cheese were everywhere and when you pull the slice, it had that glorious stretch of soft fresh cheese...the way pizza was meant to be. Johnny's burger was pretty good, better than I would expect. It looked like a gourmet burger with a half pound or so patty cooked medium rare with its juices still intact on a brioche bun. All the condiments you need are already on the table including hot sauces. Oh, and the fountain drinks include a dispenser of water infused with mint and sliced strawberries. With  a squeeze of lemon, it was amazingly refreshing and tasteful for the hot summer day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely had the midrange cafe prices but service, food, and quality was there. Good stuff.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A true gem of a cafe. I've visited DC only twice and both times have been incredible. The staff is warm and genuine. The food quality is exceptional for \"fast casual\" and adequately priced. The view of the Strip is perfect; far away! I would eat here every day if it was closer to my home.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Divine Cafe is connected to the Spring Preserves, but there is no need to be a member to dine here. If you are a member you get 10% off of your meal and membership is worth it IMHO. After having a delightful lunch you can explore all the Spring Preserves has to offer!\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost always eat outside, where you have a fantastic view of the Strip. This last visit I shared the Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato tots  and  Pizza Blanca with my boyfriend. The pizza was terrific!  And my new favorite sides are the sweet potato tots. \n",
      "\n",
      "The outdoor seating area does have heaters when it is chilly. Happy hour is on Thursdays 4pm to 8pm. They sometimes have classes on how to cook too.\n",

      "\n",
      "Food - we ordered Chicken Milanese, Teriyaki Salmon bowl & rootbeer float with oreo churros - generous portions and were all yummy. They have fruit infused water for all which was great. We're looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Its good to have options beyond the usual burger and hotdog when you are at a park\\/museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Price - reasonable though everything is $10+. Reasonable becoz portions are generous and bcoz prices at themeparks and the like are usually pricier. \n",

      "Ambiance - dine inside or outside. The patio has good view of the mountains and of the Las Vegas hotel bldgs. The patio provides enough shade. We dined in September so it was comfortable outside I just dont know how it is in the middle of hot hot Vegas summer =) The whole place is generally clean and well kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service - there seems to be adequate staff... but the food was served longer than expected. But we didn't really mind as we were enjoying the birds while we sat at the patio. All staff from the cashier to the server and table guy we're all very friendly.\n",

      "One of the best museum Cafes around! My family and I really enjoy having lunch here after our regular visit to the Springs Preserve grounds & museums. I think they offer a nice variety of great food at fair prices. So far, I really haven't had anything Ive disliked. Have tried the burger, wedge salad with chicken, Cuban sandwich, chicken sandwich & Hawaiian teriyaki bowl. All good, fresh food & good portions. I have brought a few friends here who hadn't eaten at the cafe before & they were all pleasantly surprised. When the weather gets nice outside (spring & fall), we really like sitting outside & having lunch while enjoying the amazing views. Highly recommend checking it out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had the brisket and also the vegan sandwiches. One with side salad and the other with fries. Both entrées were really good and the side salad with house dressing was surprisingly good. Also ordered the kids mac and cheese and appreciated how they had fruit and vegetables as sides. I'd get the vegan burger again. \n",
      "\n",
      "We received a membership discount so we were pleasantly surprised by our bill! I didn't give 5 stars because I would like to try another item on menu the next time we are here.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been up here about 5 times now and the latest was when Springs Preserve held their Space exhibit.  What's not to love about this place.  The food quality has always been good, you can sit outside for a good view of Springs Preserve with your meal and their menu is simple.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't come here if you're looking for a fancy place with a good view.  The menu literally consists of only salads, burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas.  Oh they do serve alcohol though!  \n",

      "The last thing I got here were the lobster rolls which was yummy.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised with the food here.  I had the tasty chicken BLT and my husband had the Cuban sandwich, which was savory.  The bread on the Cuban was a bit dry but the overall taste made up for it. We also ordered the kids chicken fingers combo, which came with fruit, carrots\\/celery, tater tots and gold fish crackers.. One of the healthier kids combos we've seen in a while. Our kid loved it.  I had a glass of their Chardonnay, which was fruity and crisp. My husband had their Lager on draft.. Refreshing\n",

      "Came here the other day with my two kids. My son ordered a quesadilla as usual and actually ate the whole thing- which he never does! It looked really good and came with a fruit skewer. I had the Mexican bento box. The meat was delicious but everything else was eh. I liked it enough to come back. Great food for kids I think.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My friend and I were recently at the Springs Preserve for the Vegas Gone Yoga festival and we decided to check out this cafe while on a lunch break. I liked that they had a variety of different vegetarian friendly options and the outdoor seating area was beautiful. When you walk in you place your order at the counter and they bring it out once it's ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "For food I decided to go with the garden sliders and a side salad. The sliders were not really a veggie patty, but more of a veggie mush. I wish they would have been more patty like, but overall the flavor was still good. (3.5\\/5) The salad was also a nice touch, very fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely a nice option for a lunch break at the park with some beautiful scenery.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went to this place yesterday and was served a buffalo chicken and blue cheese salad. My husband got a bbq brisket sandwich on a pretzel bun with fries. Or food was good, but it wasn't too hot temperature wise. Additionally the brisket sandwich was sliced brisket, so it didn't really blend with the sauce well. Because of this, my husband didn't really easy much of it. We enjoyed the food though, the service was fast and polite. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Every year I have a tradition of hiking the trails of the Springs Preserve when ghosts, goblins, wicked pumpkins, and other haunted creatures adorn the park. I never got to experience the nightime Haunted Harvest. Knowing that I was going to be in the park all day, I decided to have lunch in the park's Divine Cafe. \n",
      "\n",
      "   My expectations of theme park \\/cultural center food is convenience over quality. However, Divine Cafe exceeded my expectations. It wasn't really a shock because I had been there before to enjoy a beverage. The restaurant did have a positive vibe. Heidi Knapp Rinella in her September 25, 2014 Review Journal article \"Springs Preserve's Divine Cafe True to its Name\" says it best:\n",
      "\n",
      "       \"The Springs Preserve doesn't have to have\n",
      "        a cafe. But, like the preserve, it sure makes\n",
      "        life a lot nicer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  As soon as you exit the elevator or climb the steps above the gift shop, you enter a divine space. Your eyes immediately overlook the counter and football field of tables, chairs, and even sofas toward the glass walls with one of the most divine views in Las Vegas. This is a divine vista including a panorama of the Downtown Las Vegas skyline with the Stratosphere and Las Vegas Strip skyline framing the open spaces of dessert and wetlands. When it comes to eating with a view, Divine Cafe is a jackpot. The two places to enjoy the view are from inside and the patio. The inside is like a glass house where many tables are front row.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ordering is relatively easy. There are menus outside and at the entrance. I ordered the burger with fries and a fountain beverage. After a Yelp check-in offer for a free beverage with an entree it came to less than $11. The burger was made of the finest ingredients. This was a thick burger with tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and provolone cheese. The fries were plentiful and flavorful. The bottomless cola was refreshing. The condiments on the table made dining a better experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "  I was impressed with the service. Immediately the friendly lady greeted me when I walked inside. When I asked if the burger included cheese, she mentioned the four choices the menu omitted. She happily accepted my Yelp check in offer. Minutes after I put my number on the table, a friendly man brought my food to the table. He also cleaned up the plate. Another aspect of good customer service is confidence that no funny stuff is going on with my food. Divine Cafe has an open kitchen where I could see my food being made. Likewise, I know that it is being freshly made. On another note, Divine Cafe is especially clean. To my olfactory scent, the bathroom smelled more like the scented air in the Aria than a public restroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Just like Springs Preserves, Divine Cafe provides a terrific experience at a great price. I was very impressed. Hopefully one day I could make their Thursday Happy Hour and take in the sun going down over the panoramic vista of Downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe I'll return for their new weekend brunch. Until then, I will reward Divine Cafe with a review of four stars that says \"I'm impressed! \n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Lots of parking, but may be crowded on some days.  No need to pay the park entrance fee to eat at the cafe.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Wonderful view of the city and the park.  Inside and outside dining.  The food is pretty good.  Employees are friendly.  The manager dropped by to check on things and say hello.  Prices are a little high, but not bad.  Daily specials are served in a bento box.  The menu is designed with sustainability in mind.  Busy lunch crowd.  My favorite part of this experience is the atmosphere.\n"

      "  \n",
      "The food is surprisingly good. We had the pizza Blanca ($9.5): it had truffle oil, arugula, white sauce and mushrooms. Nice crust, good flavor. They have several decent craft brews available. We had a Samuel adams ($5-6)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was quite impressed with the cafe. I always assume food vendors and restaurants inside of museums or government buildings are more of a convenience than an actual attraction however the Divine Cafe has me waiting for next weekend to return. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love Veggie Benedict's so I gave theirs a try and to my surprise the ingredients were fresh and the presentation was impressive. The views of the valley are also worth trying the Cafe. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would have given them a 5 star review but the only reason I couldn't was because they cooked the spinach on the Veggie Benny instead of using fresh spinach leaves. This is more of a preference of mine vs an actual knock on the cafe. The rest of the menu was diverse and had many great, light summer type meals. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the menu was well thought out since most customers will be continuing their exploration of the park therefore need a light meal to avoid feeling sluggish. I enjoyde the cafe very much and can't wait to go back.\n",

      "A snacking jewel in the Preserve.\n",

      "Decent food and a surprisingly gorgeous view of the Strip is the main draw of the Divine Springs Cafe. I came here on Thursday for the Happy Hour special which is from 4pm to 8pm and offers bar food and a decent selection of beers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I went with the tater tots, that were free with a donated toy to \"Toys for Tots\", and the Chicken Nachos. I also sampled the house chips that we're placed on the table as soon as  sat down. This place is by no means a hot bed of foodie activity, but a more a refueling station after exploing the preserve.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food is on par with most bar bites, nothing was terrible, but it also wasn't mindblowing, it was just good. The Nachos are a huge portion and definitely shareable and the house chips were nice salty snack before we were inundated with salty carby treats. \n",
      "\n",
      "They only offer Happy Hour on Thursdays and the menu is pretty limited, but it's perfect food for socializing and catching up with the homies. I would recommend coming here during the day, this way you'll have a chance to snack on their full menu. \n",

      "New name and menu and improved food.  Checked our the restaurant at the Springs Preserve for the first time since the latest update.  I've eaten at the cafe 5-7 times over the years including when it was Wolfgang Puck and after as well.  I think this update is an improvement in both price and taste. We had 3 entrees and 3 kids meals for $44. My kids are 3,5,6 and the kids meals were a good amount of food for them asks included fresh fruit \\/ veggies. The kids mac n cheese is yummy and the snack tray was perfect for my 3year old. The lobster sandwich special was awesome with the tomato bisque soup especially for $10. The service was more attentive than in the past although I've never had an issue on previous visits they just seemed a little more helpful this time. In the past the foods quality was hit or miss and a little overpriced. As a member that meant we normally skipped the café.  With this update we will definitely stop more often on our visits.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Next time you're bored on a Thursday, come to Springs Preserve for a quick trail run... then swing into the Divine Cafe for Happy Hour from 4-8PM! Or just do the HH, I won't tell anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that a museum\\/park restaurant has decent food is already a delightful surprise, but throw in a liquor license and happy hour and you've actually got something pretty unique. HH features live jazz and a limited menu of appetizers and seasonal cocktails, not to mention the phenomenal view.\n",
      "\n",
      "KETTLE CHIPS: Brought to the table upon seating, decently fresh and nicely seasoned. Provided ranch for dipping? A fresh salsa would be way better!\n",
      "DEVILED EGGS: four egg halves topped with kalamata olives, simple but tasty, with a low $4 price tag.\n",
      "CHEESEBURGER SLIDERS: Nice chargrilled taste, thick patties, topped with lettuce, tomato, and burger sauce.\n",
      "ARTICHOKE AND CHICKEN NAAN: The highlight of our mini-meal! Served like a sandwich, think of a Panini made of naan, filled with cheese, artichoke, a bit of spinach, and strips of grilled chicken. This would make a good lunch option, generous portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to all that tasty food, the service changes from walk-up to table service when they transition to HH. The young ladies who attended to us were super friendly and genuine. Looking forward to coming back!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I almost hate to write to this review because sometimes you want to keep a great secret all to yourself. That's what I feel the Divine Café is - it's a place that not many people know about which is a shame because it's such a great place. It's a very open, casual place where the mix of customers seem to all be enjoying their meals. We go to the Divine Café every Saturday unless something comes up or I'm out of town and it seems like I always have the burger with cheddar cheese. These burgers are huge and come with either salad, fries, or their homemade chips. They are topped with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a really great pepper mayonnaise.  I've had great burgers here in Vegas, but for me all those other burgers don't compare to the burger here. This is the place with the best burgers. I always take the family so I've \"tasted\" other items from their menu and have to say that I have enjoyed everything I've tasted there. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Divine Café is located at the Springs Preserve so after eating we walk the trails or see the exhibits they have to offer. As members we get ten percent off our meal. The staff is always friendly - from the person taking our order to the person who brings the food to the table. It's a great place. The café has a great outdoor seating area that gives you a great view of the city. We love to sit outside and enjoy good company, good atmosphere, and good food.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I have out of town guests come to visit you know that before they leave Vegas they are going to the Divine Café.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food is delicious, waiting for the food took a while but it was during the superhero day so it was pretty busy. I wanna come here during Sunday brunch!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been meaning to check out this cafe (and the Springs Preserve) for awhile, and am happy to say it's definitely a place I'll be keeping on my \"go to\" list.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you don't need to be a member of Springs Preserve to go to the Divine Cafe, although I would highly recommend making a pleasant day\\/afternoon of it and seeing the Preserve, along with the Nevada State Museum which is also there on the grounds.   It's extremely interesting, educational and also great if you have out of town relatives or friends who are bored with the same old same old hotels, bars, Strip stuff.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Divine Cafe is wonderful to get away from  the noise, congestion and tourists - that's why so many locals have found it and enjoy going there for a bite.  It's located on the second floor near the Origen building.  You can take the elevator or stairs to get there.  It's a very open, clean and attractive space with indoor and outdoor patio seating.  If you sit on the patio\\/deck as I did, you can get a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding area, the Preserves, and off in the distance, the Strip. On a lovely day with cooler weather, it's certainly one of the more pleasant destinations around!\n",
      "\n",
      "You order your food from a nicely varied menu that serves up food every bit as good as any restaurant in town. As others have pointed out, this is not some cheapo snack bar with crappy burgers and hot dogs.  This is quality food.   When you place your order, they give you a cute little table holder with your order number.  You can sit anywhere you like, indoor or outside.    Yes, the prices are a bit on the high side, thus my four stars, however, it may be worth it to you for the location and quality.  I had the Angus burger ($9.50) and it was very good.  High quality beef, bacon strips, arugula leaves instead of the usual lettuce....I was very pleased! I ordered it \"well done\" and guess what?  It was cooked PERFECTLY!  None of that icky red beef that seems to be the \"in\" thing for burgers these days.  And the meat patty was still wonderfully juicy and had that top sirloin flavor that you'd expect from high quality beef. The bacon strips were also perfect - neither too thick nor too thin, crunchy yet not chewy as is often found on burgers today.  It  came with fries which were nicely seasoned, crisp, and flavorful.    \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the burger, I had the hazelnut beignets which came with TWO yummy dipping sauces - raspberry and caramel.  Price:  $6.00.  Again, a bit pricey but there was enough for two, so it was definitely splittable.  Total:  a bit over $16.00.  But hey, this is sort of a unique place, in the Preserves, with a view, so I guess you'd have to say you're paying for the ambiance.  The food is very good and is really  better than other places I've been, both on and off the Strip.  Bottom line, I'd for sure go back and would be happy to bring out of town visitors here for an enjoyable day of browsing the Spring Preserves and then topping it off with a lovely lunch\\/brunch on the patio looking out at the view. You can also order beer and wine, although I didn't check that out.  I can see how it would be really nice to sit with a drink for awhile there.   Servers and staff were friendly helpful and very professional.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Divine Cafe opens at 11am (weekdays), 10am on weekends (brunch),  and closes  at 3pm, so be sure to time your Preserves browsing to end  back at Divine Cafe around 1:00 or so, you don't want to feel rushed to eat and leave by 3pm.   Thanks Divine Cafe, for a very enjoyable meal!  Looking forward to doing brunch next time and having  the french toast! I'm sure it's fab!\n"

      "\n",
      "As for the food - it's good too. Used to be a Wolfgang Puck branded place, menu is a little different now, in fact they offer a good daily special board. It's run by the Culinary Institute now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had their BBQ pork sandwich, served with homemade crinkle cut chips (very tasty). The BBQ sauce was very smokey flavored, thick and a good balance of sweet and savory. Well done Culinary Institute! \n",

      "\n",
      "I had a bite of the lotsa mozza salad. It was good. It didn't look like a traditional salad. It was on a polenta cake that tasted like cornbread and had marinara and arugula on top. It was quite good. I would recommend trying it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also had the chicken Verde nachos. They were huge! Not very impressed with the taste though but nothing really that bad about them either. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What do I love about this restaurant!? I adore being able to sit outside on the terrace and eat my lunch. I love the variety of food they offer and the specials. It is near my work so every now and then I come over and dine here. I really enjoy their fresh, creative salads, the flatbreads are tasty and just last week I tried the special being tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. The service is good and looking out over the Springs Preserve into the city is absolutely beautiful not to mention relaxing. I love that they have a happy hour on Thursdays where one can come have a drink and listen to some music before heading home. As we all know driving up the 95 kinda stinks at the old 5:00 hour. They also offer creative cooking classes which I have yet to try as I am not Giada but maybe I will get around to it someday. This is a great kick back spot and we need to support this place. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!\n",

      "There aren't many restaurants more \"under the radar\" than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve. It's out of the way for most tourists visiting the Strip or Downtown and it's a destination most locals don't think of when looking for a meal, unless you're also visiting the exhibits at Springs Preserve. With a kitchen led by Steve Piamchuntar (former chef and owner of Nosh & Swig) they're serving up some surprisingly good dishes for lunch and brunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chef Steve has brought his refined skills and whimsical and modern touch to this cafe. With their recently changed menu they're offering a diverse menu with plenty for adults and kids, alike. Standard American fare like caesar salads, burgers, and pizzas are available. While the burger ($9.50) was decent, non-typical dishes make this place shine compared to other cafes in town. Singapore chicken cups ($9.50) are lettuce wraps with balanced sweetness and savoriness. The pressed chicken milanese ($11) is a must. It eats like a sandwich but has flavors that are fitting for any larger meal. For brunch the pan dulce french toast ($8) was great. More like a creamy bread pudding with bread soaked through with custard, it's perfect for those wanting to satisfy their sweet tooth early in the day. And, to polish off a meal try the root beer float ($6). It's accompanied by an Oreo dusted churro that's as good as any you'll find in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "My meal was fully comped, but I did tip appropriately. They're typically only open for lunch or brunch, but are open Thursdays and have happy hour specials and live music.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The vegan burger is my favorite thing on the menu and I'm a meat eater. It's surprisingly good. No wait, I lied. The Monte Cristo sandwich is the best thing that has ever been on the menu. Unfortunately it is no longer being sold.\n",
      "Also, the Springs Cafe is astonishingly better than the Wolfgang Puck crapshack it has replaced. There's just no comparison.\n",
      "If you're going to the Springs Preserve you'd might as well eat there. The food is pretty good and you can't beat the convenience.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great lunch spot with a diverse selection, can't beat the views and the environment of the springs preserve itself. I want to come back and try their happy hour or brunch, too, when I have more time! The only downside is each time I've been in there's only been a few people in line to order at the counter, usually only one person taking the orders, and it's been very slow. The last time it took over 20 mins to get through the three of us in line, and that's half the time I have for my lunch. Other than that, the experience and food were great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had the spinach salad with the beef, for $12 they need to throw on more spinach and less red onions, overall the salad was good.  My husband enjoyed his fish tacos and my kids could have split a kids meal, the pbj and grilled cheese sandwiches were huge and the fruit bowl that comes with the kids meal is huge too .. all for $4 per kids meal (sandwich, fruit and milk).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A very nice cafe on the grounds of the Spring Preserve. The Hawaiian pizza was really good, but I think it's bigger than they advertise. Not really a problem, but keep that in mind that two people could easily share a small personal pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great view of Vegas from the restaurant and the balcony.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent food in a relaxing atmosphere. I had a bowl of the pork fajita soup and enjoyed the rich stock, black beans, tomatoes, chunks of pork, and tortilla strips. The ice tea is flavorful. They deliver the food to your table and check on you midway through eating. I will return whenever I can.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have to say, with the change away from Wolfgang Puck's name - it's a welcome change. I was getting tired of seeing the same things on the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been here several times since the new change - and I have to admit, I like the new changes they have come up with. There are a few staples, but they also incorporate a lot of new dishes, and that has got my taste buds singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last time I came out here I had the Bento Box, my daughter the grill cheese, and the other couple I was with shared a burger meal. I loved the Bento Box - a little greasy for the egg roll, but everything else was just right!\n",
      "\n",
      "The specials are swapped out more frequently - and that is a good change to see! It's nice to see fresh ideas moving in, and get the future generations touch of good meals! You can definitely see the urge to please from the employees as you wait for your food. They show genuine concern for your happiness during your meal, and if things are delayed they are genuinely apologetic about it all! \n",
      "\n",
      "Might as well check out the rest of the preserves while you are there! (Or if you are there first, then might as well eat here!)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After a couple of hours touring the Springs Preserve I was feeling a bit hungry and thirsty.  I was also kind of hot as late May in Las Vegas is starting to warm up.  To complete my experience I thought I would give Divine Cafe a try.  It did not disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a burger because I was hungry.  I ordered an iced tea because I was thirsty.  I ordered a salad because I was hot.  It did not take long for my burger to come out.  And it came out perfect.  I asked for medium and that is exactly what I got.  It was still pink in the center and taste like quality fresh beef.  I had juice dripping down to my elbow so you know it wasn't dry.  The toppings were good too.  A nice thick slice of tomato, greens, super crisp bacon.  It was a fantastic burger.  The salad was pretty good too.  I like the greens they used.  And the cucumber slices were a nice touch.  I would have been upset about not having my choice of dressing but it was exactly what I would have ordered anyway.  A delicious vinaigrette.  The one complaint I had about the salad was the 8 inch long stripps of carrot that looked like orange noodles.  They were kind of hard to eat as they were too thin to be picked up by fork the way everything else was.  Other than that, no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was fortunate that the staff at the order window saw I had left my bag from the gift shop at the counter.  I had a couple of things in there I did not want to leave without.  Like my ball cap and sunglasses.  I was worried when I could not find my bag but then I noticed they had pushed it aside and were waiting for me to collect.  Goodonya, Divine Cafe.\n"

      "Okay, so first of all, my ahi salad was very, very good. Also, cucumber water is always a treat. And, the view is spectacular; one of the best in the city. Now that's out of the way...can we talk price vs portion? My salad was delicious, but for a $10+ salad, I'd appreciate a larger helping. I'm not even asking for more Ahi; there was plenty of that; buy dump on the greens, I can take it. Also, and this was purely circumstantial, though I can imagine it happening often: people's children. Christ on a cracker, can you please control your little zoo animals? Letting your children run, play, roll around on the floor, and use adjoining empty tables as their own jungle gyms is not only rude to other patrons, it demonstrates a significant deficiency in parental ability. To the restaurant: please discourage this kind of obnoxious behavior. I absolutely love the Preserve, but hesitate to bring my friends with me to Divine Cafe, lest we get caught up in some variant Lord of the Flies scenario. Otherwise, thanks for the fresh lunch and the relaxing, refrigerated view on a sunny day.\n",

Salads, veggies and whatnot, the salad my man ordered was amazing he loved it, fresh crispy iceberg wedge.  I got the Caesar, yummy.  We also got the CHARCUTERIE a nice basic variety of tasty Cheese and Meats but good.  We finished off with a TURKEY WRAP it was so good, I was so full but ate more then I wanted.  \n",

      "This past weekend, my bf and I did a quick trip to Champaign, because we just needed to get out of Chicago for a couple of days.  When we parked our car and walked down Green St., there were a whole bunch of NEW restaurants compared to when I went to college years ago.  One familiar restaurant was Zorba's.  Got two med. gyros, fries, and drinks to go.  When we sat outside on the quad, we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro.  So eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all!  Really good and the pita seemed fresh and light, not super greasy like the joints here in Chicago.  Don't think I'll go back to Champaign for a long time, but it's a great lunch\\/dinner option.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mmmm... gyro.  I know that Zorba's isn't authentic Greek food-- I go to Chicago for that, but for what it is, it's excellent.  The service is always very friendly and speedy, and they have a fairly large menu and is inexpensive.  They also have Killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection.  Zorba's is probably my favorite green street eatery.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came to Zorba's on the suggestion by a cousin who has, and I quote, \"never given a bad food recommendation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was another hit!  Chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At other Greek spots, I'm used to having a humongous foil wrapped hunk of a mess of gyro served to me that I inevitably finish... and end up feeling like a blob because I didn't want to waste food.  But Zorba's is here to help you with portion control!  I like how they offer their gyros in 4 different sizes.  Oh, and try the cucumber sauce.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You know you're in for a treat when it takes 9.8 seconds for the grease in your meal to seep through the bottom of the paper bag.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place was delicious!\n",
      "My roommate and I came here on default because the other place we were trying to go to was already closed!\n",
      "But good thing the gyros & fries here were delicious and made-to-order!  And the gyro meat tasted super fresh!  I loved how you can get extra cucumber sauce and the \"hot sauce\" obviously was mixed with the cucumber sauce...all delicious!\n",
      "The establishment has been open for awhile and I can see why college students would come here after partying!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "ok, so I went to Zorbas today. first time I've been there since the fire. I'll start 9ff buy saying the food tasted great as expected.\n",
      "that being said I noticed a few things that concerned me. \n",
      "1. no longer is there the choice of beef, chicken or lamb. the choices are chicken and a beef\\/lamb mix. \n",
      "2. the meat is no longer sliced to order but sliced ahead of time and kept in a steam table. it tastes better when sliced to order and heated on the griddle.\n",
      "3. the Baklava was really tough almost impossible to cut.\n",
      "remember, I DID say the food still tasted great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been here multiple times and it is truly the best place for food on Green Street. I have gone with the gyros both times and have not been disappointed. The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. On top of it, the atmosphere gives you a feel to what our culture at U of I is like. Pass up the chains and go to Zorba's. Take it from an ILLINI - you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Cool place for lunch on campus... It's right next door to Za's, where I've going a bit too often, so I'm glad I finally gave it a try. They're specialty is gyros sandwiches (on pita bread): pick your meat (lamb or chicken), size (small, medium, large), and sides (get the combo which comes with fries and a drink). I tried the chicken, and it was good, although I wish the meat had been a little more grilled (it wasn't crispy at all). Their fries are great! They also have a few other things on the menu (regular sandwiches etc), and they're open late most nights. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Loved the Greek salad and gyro plate. This is a staple in  campus town for good reason. The inside displays classic Illini newspaper clippings, and the staff is kind and welcoming. Check them out if you're in the mood for a gyro.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The gyros were pretty good, but their fries came with this amazing sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a delish combination of honey mustard but smelled and tasted like there was bacon in it.  I'm not sure what exactly it was but we couldn't stop dipping our fries in it - so good!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great gyros and fries. Often crowded, so plan on a wait for food and a table.  Go on Tuesdays for discount prices.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is fantastic. Everything from their gyros to hummus to fries are all on point. Live jazz is great (I forget which nights) and their special deal on Tuesdays makes this a great lunch spot on Green Street. This place definitely exceeds expectations in Chambana, and I hope it continues to thrive!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hands down the most underrated place on campus. Everything they offer is at least good, while their gyros are nothing short of amazing (for Chambana, at least). The jazz shows are a nice touch, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff is always friendly. One of my favorite places to spend a break, whether it's between classes or during work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't offer enough food on the level of their gyros to warrant a five-star rating, but it deserves a strong four.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Matt and his gang do a great job. Love the chicken Gyros.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good food and I love all the dipping sauces.  Best gyro I've had on campus.  Not a huge variety of food, though.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "so greasy it burned the fuck down ! i am sure each gyro and basket of fries i ate there each knocked 6 months off of my lifespan. All I can say is I;m still alive so I obviously didn't eat there enough\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tender gyros meat at decent prices. Just stick with a gyros sandwich (the fries are mediocre). This place has been around since my parents were on UIUC's campus in the early-mid 70s and it's a great place to take them. I can't speak to the seating during peak hours because I usually would drop by here if there was a deal on Hooked midafternoon if I hadn't eaten lunch.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The classic chicken gyro is one of the simplest and best gyros I have ever eaten though the taste could have been more exotic. The Hooked deal of getting a meal in the cost of a gyro for take out is quite cheap and worth the price. Also I would recommend fish lovers to visit on Friday as they have some amazing deals and fish  dishes on friday.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "i used to eat the gyros here as a student and loved them...now that i'm all grown up i still love to eat here but i just eat the veggies on a pita with that yummy cucumber sauce and still love their fries.  i think what i love about this place more than the food is the fact that every single time i come here, i run into a friend, who is likely another uiuc alum, who happens to also have ended up living here, we strike up a conversation and realize the place feels even better when you're not procrastinating studying for an exam.\n"

      "You like gyros? You like fresh fries? You like Green Street? Well, then you'll love Zorbas.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Zorbas was a staple during undergrad and it hasn't lost its taste in the years since I've left.  Regardless of where I move or visit, every gyro I have is compared to Zorbas - they're the gold standard in my mind.  The meat is always juicey and the fries always salty.  Perfect for a social lunch or a recovery meal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Word to the wise - load that sucker up with extra meat and tzatziki sauce (or \"cucumber sauce\") for maximum flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is where I spend 20 minutes every Tuesday night.  Good gyros, cucumber sauce, etc., and thanks to Groovy Tuesdays you can get a kickass feta (+hummus, if you like) veggie pita for a little over $2.  Service is fast and it's not usually too crowded.  Nice, tall tables too.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good good fast! Pricing was reasonable. I was a bit taken aback by my hummus and pita arriving as a sandwich instead of separate. The bread was great, the hummus was just average. I really liked my gyro though!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Awesome gyros. Especially when you're listening to Spyro Gyra. On iTunes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is some incredibly tasty and greasy food. I walked around like a confused tourist for a moment while looking for the menu. I'm pretty indecisive so I would prefer a menu that wasn't taped to the counter where you order. Being able to peruse a bit would have been nice. Even so, I ordered a falafel with feta and jalapenos and it was fantastic. Even the fries were delicious and I'm just not a potato fan. The biggest pro - They have a tzatziki dispenser! Most places charge you for extra and considering condiments are the highlight of my meal, this was fantastic! I also thought the gyros were delicious although it is tough to mess that up I think. The price is great, you can eat here for just about $5.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great Greek food including awesome Gyros!! They also have live music here a lot which is a great escape from doing your homework!  This place gets busy as lunch because it's right by the quad!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gyros, tzatziki, fries, and friendly cooks and cashiers make this place a must-go.  My parents graduated from the U of I in 1981, and Zorba's was there back then!  Considering the relatively high turnover rate of Campustown restaurants, I think that's pretty impressive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A Champaign Institution, great gyros, with even better service.  Definitely a can't miss when you are on Illinois' campus.  Check their daily specials before you go in some of them are great.  The fact that you can order a small, medium. or large gyro and customize it however you want make it good for any size appetite.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Going up to four stars and rising.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Have only been there once but was a big fan of the gyros. Had an large original gyro with fries and was a pretty good deal for $7.50. Very tasty\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yep, it lived up to the hype. Great gyro sandwiches with a cool local feel. The pita is soft and the gyro meat is some of the most tender I've found. Brilliantly seasoned too, the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart. I also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place has a nice, local college hotspot feel. Not wild and crazy, but more the kind of place students stop by on their way to and from class.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I love the gyros here.\n",
      "I love their cucumber sauce even more :)\n",
      "You can pick the size of gyro you want, so you can load up on as much as as little meat as you please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is good and there is plenty of room to eat right in the restaurant.  The only \"problem\" is that you'll smell like gyro, onion, and grease when you leave.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I absolultely LOVE gyros so this is a no-brainer for me. I feel like this place is a staple of quick, delicious campus food. It's pretty much a total hole in the wall, but it's totally Illini, everything about the decor just screams it. Not to mention the gyros are bomb. Go if you haven't already!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "good ole z-bots as we liked to call this one back in the day.  yes, this place is an institution...been around since green and wright was just spaceport, garcias, and mcdonalds.  hasnt changed much cept that now i can drink the beer.  wonder if they will still accept my stamp card from way back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't believe I walked past this place for three years.  What is more sad is that many of those times were likely while I walked into Subway across the street on a Tuesday afternoon to drop $5 on a Veggie Delight.  Little did I know I could get a delicious, warm, and fresh vegetable hummus pita across the street for a little over a dollar.  At least I have many more Tuesdays ahead to take advantage!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Definitely some of the best falafel I've eaten. This is a great place to go for lunch or a casual, light dinner.  The employees are friendly, the location is convenient, and the prices are reasonable.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After my horrendous experience with Niro's I was optimistic that Zorba's might have a better gyro.\n",
      "\n",
      "The store is right on Green street and impossible to miss walking by. Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I did not like was the portion\\/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be back to try more!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Gyros are soooo tasty, I keep coming back for more. Price is okay and service is fast. Only complaint would be portion size for their salads...their small was much smaller than in most places, but it was yummy. Seriously try their gyros.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decent gyros at a decent price -- a large gyro combo costs around $7, and less if you manage to get a deal on the Hooked app. The meat is a tad dry, but the sauces somewhat make up for it. 3.5 stars\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What can you say about a campus institution like Zorba's? If you crave great gyros sandwiches and fries served fast, this is the place to visit. Super Niro Gyros serves good food but Zorba's has them beat for a quality product. Not a place to come for ambience, unless you like hanging out with self-absorbed Millennials with hands permanently attached to their iPhones. The tzatziki sauce is worth the price of admission though. Highly recommended.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I took the recommendations of many and did make a reservation for a Saturday night a few days in advance, which was wise because we got the last table available. The space might be tiny, and the chairs might wobble a little bit, but the latin music will keep your body swaying. You will definitely find an authentic Mexican feel compared to any of the other restaurants in the city, but on to the food!\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the grilled corn with lime and quesco fresca. It is permeated with lime, and it tastes as if it has been swimming in a vast sea of lime. It is quite flavourful and delicious. Just wish it came with more cobs!\n",
      "\n",
      "For our mains, we shared a plate of the ancho braised short rib tacos in the golden crispy tortillas, and a plate of tacos al pastor. The better of the two was definitely the ancho braised short rib. The crispy taco sets them apart from some of the other taco joints in the city, and the flavour and texture was quite superior to the tacos al pastor. The only downside is they can be a little messy. The tacos al pastor was pretty light on the pineapple, and could have used a little sauce, and even seemed smaller than the short rib. Plus they came in a soft tortilla shell which wasn't as special. I don't think I'd order them again. On the other hand, the short rib tacos were good enough that we ordered another round.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on to dessert. The tres leches cake was amazing and one of the best desserts I've ever had. At a reasonable 7 dollars, and big enough for sharing. This is a dessert you don't want to pass on. It isn't overall sweet, and it doesn't taste one note. I found the taste and texture of the dessert transformed in my mouth and finished differently on both accounts. 5 stars for this dessert, and would be the main reason I would go back. It will leave you feeling good about your choice of passing on a McFlurry from McDonald's on the way home, and if that is not a win, I don't know what is.\n"

      "\n",
      "When we showed up the place was pretty full, both inside and on the patio. We asked one waiter what the wait was for a table inside (as it was pretty chilly out) he said 30-45 minutes, I was so sad! Luckily another waiter spotted us and told us there was a table of 2 that had just cleared up - so we eagerly took a seat.\n",

      "To drink: we ordered 2 Micheladas (Mexican beer, lime juice, and assorted sauces, spices, and peppers. It is served in a chilled, salt-rimmed glass) - it wasn't on the Menu - so if you haven't tried it yet - I definitely recommend it! To eat: We ordered Ceviche del Dia (I am Peruvian and so by default am a ceviche judge), 3 Tacos de Pescado (Baja Style) and 3 Tacos Ancho braised Shortrib brisket Crispy Tacos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The server punched in the Ceviche but the kitchen never saw it, so they forgot about the Ceviche, which had me a bit bummed at first, but then when I was about finished my third taco, I  realized it was probably a blessing in disguise... I was absolutely full! The Tacos were great, they Brisket tacos, had pico de gallo, frejoles and guac, they were very rich in flavours, very tasty; and the fish tacos were larger and more filling than I expected, fried goodness - squeeze that whole lime wedge on top and you have perfection!!\n",

They are ALWAYS bust so don't bother trying to go without a reservation unless maybe on a weekday around 5. They do allow you to make online reservations, but they're usually pretty booked up for weeks in advance and don't accommodate large groups. Anyway, the food is delicious so I guess it's worth it!\n",
      "\n",
      "The portion sizes are good (I usually can't finish), which when compared to the too-small and too-costly options at their sister restaurant down the street (Hacienda) is a welcome change! The decor is beautiful and the music gives it a great vibe.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

We had the best seat right at the front of the restaurant with open windows looking out to the street. Awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "They really do appreciate food presentation here. Near the back half of the restaurant they had all the seafood sitting on ice! Lobster, crab, oysters. This ice tray of deliciousness was positioned near the guy that likely prepares it and some other dishes. It made me want to order the seafood, so good on them.\n",

If you're getting an appetizer to share I would recommend getting these tacos without the beans and rice. They were very filling on their own. They had this light but creamy coleslaw mix on top of the battered fish which was a nice contrast to the deep-fried-ness of the fish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Including ours, all the meals I saw served around us looked very fresh and well presented. The food has definitely lived up to the hype, in presentation and taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and made good recommendations. The only downside to the evening was the time it took for our appetizer and food to be served: longer than normal. I also wish their sipping tequila wasn't $14 minimum an ounce, I passed on it this time. It's expensive because it's excellent quality, so I understand. The cheaper tequilas were ones you shoot and they had a huge selection. I will have to explore their tequila menu more next time I'm here!\n",

It was awful outdoor weather for both driving and walking as people forget how to drive in snow and the flakes are blowing everywhere so it's hard to look up.  I finally stumble into the intimacy of Playa Cabana only to find a very busy and bustling restaurant with all tables full, a line up of folks crowding in the small entranceway and a waiting list that only has openings in about an hour and a half. \n",

At first I was worried about portions, as everything look small on yelp, however food was soo filling! The staff was warm and welcoming however they were not as attentive as they should've been. They were quick to seat us & say hello but didn't take initiative to check on their tables, instead most servers were huddled around the bar just socializing. This caused quite a waiting game when I was in need for water or when we wanted to order our mains & dessert. I'd only hope the service is better the next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm not going to lie - have never been the biggest fan of Mexican food. That being said, had a very good experience here. I think what stands out the most is really the atmosphere of the place - very European feel. A real pleasure to go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was 7\\/10. Had the beef flutes, civiche, guacamole, salsa, and fish tacos. Overall, very well prepared, but the tastes weren't 100% to my liking, again, possibly biased haha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, the group was very happy with the meal, and the Sangria was pretty good (ask for less ice). Parking isn't too hard to find by the way, but you should expect to look on the streets. I'd say it's a great date place as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "In between our office and hotel, this was the perfect choice for us. We were seated in the back alcove . They sell beers by the bucket so we said why not? Our server was nice and didn't rush us or anything. I got the carnitas tacos and they were good. Pretty authentic food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really enjoyed the dinner. Guacamole was excellent. Split some fish and chicken tacos and really liked both. The only knock is that there was no beer on tap; bottle selection was good though.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been to many different playa cabana locations and I must say that they have great tacos! I have had some times where the service is slow, however, the food is always great and satisfying\n",

      "I'm a native Californian, so when deciding to take my fiancee, a Toronto resident, for Mexican food, I thought that I would have to aggressively contain my expectations given that most of my Canadian friends complain about the dearth of good Mexican food here. I was surprised by how delicious the food was but I was dismayed by some aspects of the service. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, despite the fact that the restaurant was not remotely busy, we were not approached by a server for at least ten minutes after being seated. In fact, the hostess had to ask another server to see us because our intended one just kind of fu*ked off and attended to maintaining his bizarre Caucasian-Last-Samurai-topknot-bro-on-a-spiritual-granola-journey haircut.  Thanks, guy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our replacement server, Raul, kept the party going and did the damn thing and did so promptly and politely. Commendations to Raul. The food was to our liking, although it does kind of feel like you're paying for the restaurant's comforts when you can get the same caliber food at a truck in Los Angeles for a fraction of the cost. Despite the omitted fifth star, I would urge folks in Toronto desperate for a quality Mexican food experience to try this place out. DEFINITELY make reservations first. There is no harm in doing so and it struck me as the sort of place that is frequently busy, as it was tonight.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent. Tried the corn as an appetizer - must have. And then we ordered a burrito (huge) and the enmoladas (also great). Then we tried the Tres Leches cake - honestly the best I've ever had, a MUST HAVE.\n",

Their portions are generous and it feels and tastes like authentic mexican food.  Packed full of flavour.  The meat pork in the playa burrito was divine and my tacos were juicy yet crispy from the shells.  I will go back to try the other items on the menu.\n",

      "\n",
      "The food was awesome! Lots of flavour. I don't think there was anything we didn't like. Some of the favorites amongst the group included the shrimp bucket, lobster taco, both types of fish taco, and braised short-rib taco. They were all very tasty and served with a healthy portion of meat.\n",

I'd recommend getting more appetizers than meals. My fav combo is the guac, the corns and the shrimp (sorry I don't recall the Spanish words). I personally didn't love the Chorizo sausage. It was too spicy and saucy for me. \n",

      "So you and your friend have a hankering for Mexican food  while downtown....I wanted to see if this place was about the food or about the flash. Located at 111 Davenport Rd, ( note: they have a second location in the junction) it is a little hidden from the main strip of the Avenue Rd \\/ Yorkville restaurants. It felt to me more of a locals hangout as the customers and staff seemed familiar with each other. \n",
      "The restaurant is small and cozy with a very nice patio. Decor was nice and tasteful unlike some other Mexican places that want to scream at you that they are Mexican (Also, I'm glad they didn't do that whole \"day of the dead\" theme that a lot of places are doing these days) anyway, now to the food. \n",
      "They have a good menu that highlights the usual fare. Tacos, enchiladas, as well as main plates. The liquor menu is what you would expect in a Mexican restaurant with lots of tequila choices and Mexican beer. ( $20 for a 5 bucket of beer) I started with a Dave's margarita on he rocks( they don't serve the slushy kind) and the usual guacamole dip and the daily ceviche both served in a stone bowl and made fresh. Both were excellent and well made. I opted for the Carne Asada platter with beans and rice and tortillas. The presentation was nice and the portions were good. Now I have had this dish at other places before (in Mexico) and I prefer my meat cooked and served without sauce on it. The flank steak was good but it was cover in the sweet sauce that overpowered the flavour of the meat. The sauce was good and maybe it should be used as a side but not smothering the meat. Everything else was cooked perfectly and very tasteful.  Overall this place is good and well deserving of a try. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the sauce over the meat thing ....mmmm meat....\n",

We almost walked right past it, it was so well blended in with its surroundings. I'm giving it 4 stars, however, it is a reluctant 4 as I feel like today it should have been 3, but I have to acknowledge its 5 star potential. Confused enough yet? \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me explain:\n",
      "\n",
      "- HOT SAUCE GAME IS ON POINT. There were 2 different hot sauces at our table and 2 different jars of chilli. For those who like spice, you will be in heaven! \n",
      "- The salsa appetizer with daily made tortillas was an excellent appetizer to share - although I usually prefer my salsa ingredients diced rather than blended, it was still very good.\n",
      "- We had originally ordered the ceviche but the server forgot to put in our order and we only realized once our mains were served with no sign of the ceviche - thought it would be odd to eat ceviche with our burritos so asked for salsa and tortillas instead. The salsa and tortillas was then comped for us, so we were satisfied \n",
      "- I ordered the playa burrito with ancho-braised steak - the portion was massive, could not finish it and brought some home with me. While it was delicious, it was served to me lukewarm... I hate when my food is lukewarm... I just didn't want to send it back when we already dealt with the appetizer issue. \n",
      "- The restaurant is very small - seating is a little cramped and without resos you may be given a time that you need to be finished by. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite some errors, I do intend to go back - I have a feeling that I went on an off day and want to give this restaurant another shot. There are also many other items from the menu that I would like to douse with their hot sauces!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Small tight place but the food makes it up for it, where the fish taco was AMAZINGLY and their homemade chips with salsa.\n",

      "I live right in the area and i'll definitely go back more often during the summer!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Closer to a 4.5\\/5. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Homemade guac and chips: Excellent, love that you can vary the heat-level. \n",
      "-Corn on the cob: Heavenly, slathered with cheese, onions, and lime juice.\n",
      "-Chicken wings: Not too greasy, good amount of spice.\n",
      "-Lobster tacos: Amazing. Lobster was soft and succulent. The guac that came with it also tasted incredibly fresh. \n",
      "-Baja fish tacos (battered): I'd say overall they were tasty and fresh, but nothing out of this world. I like how they didn't over-batter the fish. \n",
      "-Dave's margarita. Maybe a little too much ice, but still went down smoothly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The space is a bit cramped, so it's probaly not the best option for an intimate one-on-one. Music can be a bit loud. On the plus side, our server was friendly and very attentive. And considering all the food we ordered, the bill at the end of the night was also pretty reasonable.\n"

      "This place deserves its great food reviews. Their shortrib crispy tacos are about the most flavourful thing I've had in any Mexican restaurant in Toronto (including all those places open in the past couple of years where people like to line up for tacos) - assuming you like the idea of moist, saucy meat, freshly deep-fried shell, oozy cheese and creamy cool crema and guac on the side. I'm not an expert on \"authenticity\", but it's definitely delicious and not watered down for gringos.  They always have a daily ceviche and the fish tacos are great too. It tends to get really busy and may not be a good place to bring squirmy kids, but it's not hard to get a seat for two at off-peak hours. Their nacho chips are also freshly deep fried and crispily addictive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Playa Cabana definitely lived up to the hype. Went with a large group which presented the opportunity to do a tasting menu of a variety of different tacos and some apps as share plates. Listing everything would be an endeavour but the stand outs were definitely the fresh, flakey fish tacos, savoury rib steak tacos, and flavourful octopus tacos. The tostadas were impressive and the in-house hot sauces were all phenomenal. Definitely made a lasting impression, not to mention a great tequila selection and cocktail list.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went to Playa Cabana with a relatively large group (12-13 people) and they were great. I had the Guaca Fresca, which was amazing. Large portion of guacamole (mild is actually not spicy at all), and the chips were delicious as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the main, I had the Tacos De Pescado, which is the fish tacos. The tacos were on the sour-side of the taste palette, especially with the coleslaw in it. I would recommend not putting any more lime on it. The fish was very fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, customer service was great as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "\n",
      "The guac was amazing: not too heavy and very fresh. The surf and turf burritto could've fed an entire mexican village! It was very well done but I would've preferred the orange sauce on the side instead of submerging the burrito in it. I prefer my dishes spicy so I asked for their spicy salsa and our server got me two kinds of spicy salsa. I absolutely loved them both! So folks ask for the spicy salsa. The churros were great as well: doughy, cinnamony,creamy!\n",

      "Mexican iced tea ($10) - Tromba blanco tequila, los Arango reposado tequila. Cazadores añeja tequila, triple sec, freshly squeeze lime, and Coca Cola\n",
      "I had the Amber agave and it was, hands down, the best margarita I've had!  I really wanted to order another one, but unfortunately couldn't because I had to drive later that night.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the guaca fresca ($8), which was absolutely delicious! It was so fresh and creamy, I just wanted to eat this all night long! The guaca fresca comes in mild, medium, and hot. We asked for mild and they gave us two types of hot sauce on the side. I enjoyed both of them, but the habanero one (on the left) was really quite spicy, even for me. The other one- a roasted chile arboles salsa- was just perfect!\n",
      "\n",
      "tacos de pescado ($13) Baja-style with catch of the day, fresh battered with Tecate-cerveza. I can't recall what the catch of the day was, but I didn't particularly care for it. The fish wasn't as flaky and light as I'd like it to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ancho braised short rib-brisket crispy tacos ($14)- AAA Ontario Beef short rib braised in ancho chiles wrapped in fresh corn tortillas and griddled to a golden crispiness, served with pico de gallo, guacamole and homemade crema. This was definitely a heavier taco, and the flavours were also a lot bolder. The short rib-brisket combination was extremely juicy, resulting in an incredibly messy eating process (not that I'm complaining). All in all, I enjoyed the crispy taco, but it was so filling that I wouldn't be able to eat more than one.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Playa burrito with pork carnitas ($14), served with fresh guac, pico de gallo, crema, green tomatillo sauce and red tomato sauce. I'm not a big fan of  burritos in general, but I've read so many great reviews about the ones here that I was sorely tempted to try one. First of all, I thought the presentation was so pretty with the two contrasting sauces. Secondly, the portion was huge- our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomach! I was intimidated by the sheer massiveness of all the that pork, rice and beans- it was almost like a brick. In the end, Mel and I struggled to finish the whole burrito, and neither of us liked the green tomatillo sauce that much. To be fair, this was probably a very good burrito, but it was just not for me\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it was a birthday celebration, we obviously had to have dessert! First up, an order churros ($6). Unfortunately, I didn't love this version, as the dough was a little too dense and   the flavours were lacking a punch because they ran out of the cajeta dipping sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second dessert was a traditional Mexican flan ($7), and while it didn't look very pretty, the flavours certainly made up its looks. The flan was velvety smooth and rich, and even the side of whipped cream was delectable!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed dinner at Playa Cabana. The drinks were excellent, and I'd come back just for the guaca fresca! Though next time, I'd probably stay away from the burrito.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I came because of the yelp reviews. But now I'm going to keep coming because the food proved itself. It's soooo good. It's a little bit pricier than some of the other places in Kensington Market but they offer some really good stuff here. One of my personal favorite is the Playa burrito. It's so filling you can probably split it with someone. They also have a really big patio at the back so don't be fooled by how tiny the storefront looks. Service was really slow but good made up for it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was great and fresh. So full of wonderful flavors! The server was friendly. The atmosphere is lively and fun. The prices are high but the taste is worth the cost.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They do a great mexican! Vodka cesar's with Tromba is where it's at - also the spicy guac... Minus points for it always being packed - but i guess that's because it's small...\n",

      "1. Like others who have mentioned this, I did feel rushed to order, then to order more, then to leave. This was slightly annoying, but we were having a good time anyway, and didn't really think much of it until after we left.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The tacos are a bit small, but they are fresh and delicious. I would order the chicken tacos again. (Be warned! Some of the table sauces are quite spicy!)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If you like guacamole, you will love their chips and guacamole. The chips, which can be a tinge greasy, are tasty and made in house.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The service, aside from being a bit rushed, was good. The recommendations for food and drinks were perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The vibe is loud and fun. I noticed that there was quite a diverse crowd here, which is nice as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. They have indoor and outdoor seating. To be mere steps from the corner of Davenport and Dupont, the outdoor patio seems quite removed from city traffic and noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great spot. There probably aren't many places in Toronto that can match Playa Cabana for Mexican food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Positively delicious food. But unfortunately, service is on and off (and when it's off, it's positively terrible). On the other hand, if you're served by the right person, you're in good hands. \n",
      "\n",
      "We visited for dinner on a weekday evening and we were seated dismissively by a server who waved us towards the direction of an empty table. Then we sat there and waited. And waited. And waited. For someone to give us a pair of menus. The place wasn't busy at all; servers were just sitting around involved in their own conversations. We tried to wave someone down several times to get a hold of menus, but no cigar. Because, obviously, we came to your restaurant just to sit, twiddle our thumbs, and stare at people eating (not). A good 20 minutes went by before a server came by and asked us what we wanted to order... unfortunately, without a menu we had no idea what to order. She seemed embarrassed that no one had given us menus or had greeted us yet, and brought us menus from the front. From that point forward, service was perfectly fine, as our server attempted to make up for the cold beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the guacamole and chips appetizer, the tacos de carnitas, braised short rib brisket  tacos, and a playa burrito. Absolutely delicious. My highlight was definitely the guacamole and chips combo - the chips were homemade, crunchy, and didn't taste like the usual run-of-the-mill corn chips you can get just anywhere. So delicious and had a very interesting texture - they definitely tasted and felt homemade. The burrito was quite large and a bit hard to eat, but the meat in both the burrito and the tacos were very tender and perfectly cooked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance is super dim and romantic - this is a great spot for a date or even dinner with friends. Very casual, relaxing atmosphere. For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $58.\n"

      "Summary: Overall I really enjoyed my lunch at Playa Cabana. The restaurant itself is quite small so make sure to go early or make reservation. Seats are quite close together so it's not the most comfortable but you gotta give a little when it's for awesome food!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent Mexican, and probably very authentic (but what do I know?).\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was surprisingly busy on a Monday night, but we managed to snag a table for four without issue. The seating is TIGHT though; expect to be rammed against the seat behind you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chips and guac are excellent, though I didn't care for the wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the tacos al pastor were good, I think they were trumped by my partner's tacos de chori-queso. I mean, sausage and cheese? Yes please.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the burritos knock the tacos out of the park. In terms of value there's no comparison (burrito the size of my fat head), but the sauces they layer on top are phenomenal. I started diverting chips meant for the guacamole into the remnants of my dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordering to go is a hassle-free process, and they were prompt and punctual with the food. Given how tight the resto is take-out will be a viable option for us, despite the warm vibe of the place.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Big portion sizes at a not-so-bad price! Their in-house made chips and salsa are delicious. I'm not the most well-versed in all things Mexican, but this place comes off quite authentic - from when you first step over the threshold of what used to be a house to this small, intimate restaurant with Mexican music playing. They even had the heat turned up because my glasses fogged up as soon as I came in from the brisk March air. I'd definitely come back or at least check out their other location at DuPont and Avenue which is closer to the Yonge subway line.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is always busy but take reservations - yay!  There is a cute alcove in the back where we sat and began our journey at the Playa Cabana.  \n",
      "\n",
      "From the group, we got a bunch of share plates.  \n",
      "\n",
      "GUACAMOLE & SALSA - the guac was very fresh and came in those heavy stone bowls.  The Salsa was definitely the winner, it was very flavourful and the right amount of spice.  Very well done.\n",
      "\n",
      "FISH CEVICHE - this was a pleasant surprise!  It was tangy and citrusy and it cooked the fish just right with the blend of fresh herbs and lime.  \n",
      "\n",
      "CHORIZO CONQUISTADORES - couldn't even pronounce it, the server was very helpful!  It was all right, the was thin strips of meat in a slab of red sauce, wasn't a huge table fav.\n",
      "\n",
      "CUBETA DE CAMARON - this was definitely a winner, it was very delicious!  The shrimp were large and juicy!  The shrimp was tossed in a cajun butter sauce and when you sprinkle the lime on it, it is perfection!  Everyone at the table was pleased and the portion was plentiful!\n",
      "\n",
      "BEEF ENCHILADAS SUIZAS - this was a very large portion which would have been ideal for 2 if you were to share appies.  It was great, it was beef-off-the-bone tender, and the flavours were delicious.  It came with rice, guac and a choice of black or pinto beans.  A great choice!\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was great, very fast, attentive and took the time to explain everything and check on us to make sure we had everything.  The drink were another winner.  The MARGARITAS are famous there and they come in a pitcher!!!  We got the house Margarita (the first one on the drink menu) and it was so tangy and not too sweet, we shared it amongst 4 ladies and we got pretty tipsy after a few pitchers, at $29 you can definitely have a great time and get affordable drinks.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The bill after splitting everything was about $50 per person which was mucho affordable.  Must go, it was a great experience.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "BEWARE!!! You will need to get reservations at least a week in advance cause this place is sooooo popular and tiny as well. One of the best fish tacos I've had in toronto and certainly authentic mexican food. The mexican corn was $9 and was not worth it at all but it was dammmmm good. This place can become quite pricy when things add up. We got 2 tacos, corn and beer which all came up to about $65 bucks. Its a great place none the less but I probably wont be coming back here for a while\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Love this place! It is tiny, so definitely make a reservation. But, the atmosphere and food is great!\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been here a couple of times, and our favourite dish is the burrito. This thing is HUGE, but I actually managed to eat all of it. It is stuffed to the brim with deliciousness, and then topped with different sauces. I couldn't tell you what the sauces are, but it's magic. The homemade chips are salty, crunchy and fresh, and make an awesome pair to the homemade guacamole. \n",
      "\n",
      "On our first visit, I had the ancho braised short rib brisket crispy tacos, and I wasn't a fan at all. The filling was really heavy, with no citrus or acidic flavour to contrast. The tacos were also soggy, and I couldn't eat them with my hands. We will definitely be returning for the burritos!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Without a doubt, this is the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto.\n",
      "It reminds me a lot of Grand Electric in many ways, but I rate it higher than Grand Electric because the menu is authentic, larger, they takes reservations, and the place has a level of raw authenticity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food will blow your mind. It's simple and real mexican flavours, taco's made from scratch, kitschy and funny menu items like the bucket of shrimp, beautifully real ceviche, and even oysters. And well on the reasonably cheap side of the spectrum. \n",
      "\n",
      "The space is intimate and cute. It's tucked away at Dupont and Davenport, and is a neat little place to get away from the craziness of the Annex but still experience it's charm. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service is excellent. But don't go without a reservation. You will wait an hour or two even with the patio open in the summer.\n"

Had the choriqueso tacos, the meat was well seasoned and cooked right, the cheese was queso Oaxaca, you can't usually find that here and when you do it's often not good but not in this case. Service was prompt, it's a small place but they had plenty of people on staff. Would definitely dine here again. \n",

      "\n",
      "What it lacks in size, it makes up for in quality of food. Toronto isn't known for their Mexican food, but this place breaks the mould. We ordered the guac and chips to start, baja fish tacos and steak burrito as mains, and the homemade lemonade to drink. The food was fresh and flavorful. The lemonade was on the sweet side, but good. We left full and happy and will be returning.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our friends suggested this place to us when we went to visit them in Toronto as this is their go-to spot for great Mexican food and I can definitely see why ! The food was so fresh and flavourful and the portions were very filling and for a great price ! we shared the spicy shrimp bucket to start , the shrimp were nice and big and very fresh but if you're not a fan of spicy this may not be the choice for you. butttttt if you like spicy food like I do then these are a great choice - muy caliente ! We also had the octopus taco which I was very excited about since I love octopus but I never really had it in taco form - it was delicious (also spicy) the octopus was grilled to perfection and the fresh corn and fresh toppings made it even better. As the main course my boyfriend and I shared the chorizo burrito which came topped with a fried egg, salsa Roja, salsa verde and cotija cheese. The burrito is pretty big and pretty freaking delicious ! (Though not really spicy but very flavourful). For dessert we shared the tres leches cake which was so light and not overly sweet. Also worth mentioning is the fact that they offer indoor and outdoor seating and do serve a variety of beers and cocktails. My only complaint is that the indoor seating is a little bit tight so there's not much room but as soon as the awesome food came I forgot all about that ! All in all I really enjoyed playa cabana and think it's a great spot to go with some friends or a date for some great Mexican food !\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A friend and I were looking for a nice lunch spot after visiting castle Casaloma. We came across this small but cozy authentic Mexican place. They served us house made chips with guacamole as appetizers. The guacamole is served in a molcajete (stone bowl). I thought that was pretty cool!!\n",
      "For our mains we got fish tacos (Tacos de Pescado) and beef short rib tacos (Ancho Braised Short rib crispy Tacos). They were amazing!!\n",

Small little place which gets larger with the amazing patio on the outside. We started out on the patio but unfortunately the rain took us inside to a very hip locale with bar seating in the middle of the restaurant. Not sure what it was but there was lots of groups of young women at the restaurant this night.  \n",

      "Order the Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos!!! Amazingly delicious. Slap- your- mama -in- the- face good! The Ceviche is a great app, their guac is really authentic and good too. My only complaint is if you sit indoors its pretty cramped. I was elbowed in the head at least 2 times, but on the plus side the waiter was good looking. Fish tacos are a little bland. \n",
      "Decent prices too.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The short rib tacos are the bomb diggity! Never knew you could put rib meat into tacos, but I'm glad they invented it. Perfectly sweet with a nice tangy finish. Rich and diverse. Excellent mouthfeel too - that short rib was tender and moist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish tacos sucked though. It's a catch of the day dish, and today's was baja. We got grilled (as opposed to battered) at the recommendation of our server. It looked kinda bland, tasted bland (reminiscent of overlooked and browned scrambled eggs) and was soggy to the point where the soft tortilla fell apart in my hands and I had to eat the taco ashamedly with a fork and knife. Save your fish taco cravings for seven lives in Kensington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guac and chips appetizer was real nice. The guac comes in a nice stone mortar (great looking touch), and comes in three spicy levels: mild medium spicy. The spicy level has the perfect kick to it - spicy, but not overbearing. The chips are homemade and fried - hint of egg, and real tasty, although some -very few- were a bit too oily).\n",

      "\n",
      "The tacos de langosta where the ones I didn't like much. Too greasy, messy and blah. The hardshell tastes like a bunuelo (fried bread), not like tortilla. You can't hold them, cut them or bite them in peace. They had enough lobster, but they lacked flavor.\n",

      "I dream about this place. Their guacamole and bottomless chips are addictive. My friends and I devoured two orders of it and they just kept asking us if we wanted more chips. Um, yes. Never stop giving them to me. The enchiladas suizas are amazing, and the jarritos are a nice non-alcoholic option. The tres leches cake makes me want to cry, it's so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a tiny place so make sure to have reservations, and it's good to note that it can get very loud. If you can deal with a somewhat cramped and lively space for the fantastic food, then you need to try this place.\n",

      "Playa Cabana is nestled on a residential street at Davenport and Dupont.  Rumours about not being able to get in without a reservation are definitely true - even at lunch time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came here on a Friday afternoon around 1:30PM and the place was packed.  Just when hopes of a table came up, we were told the fellas at the bar had dibs on it.  I can see why because the bar was definitely cramped when it came to leg room in an already small restaurant.  I would say it seats no more than 40 and the servers really have to do a whole dance to maneuver around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one good thing that came of sitting at the bar is a full frontal view of the kitchen as well as one of the best bartenders in the city.  He was attentive, entertaining and makes, in my humble opinion, one of the best Mojitos in the city.  While you can opt for the traditional (made with rum) - tequila lovers can rejoice as he offers that as an alternative.\n",

      "A sign on the wall proudly announces that they make their own soft shell corn tortillas in house - a bragging right that most restaurants cannot herald.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the Guaca Fresca ($8) which comes in mild, medium or spicy.  We opted for the spicy and didn't find it to be spicy.  The guac itself was rather bland, as were the chips.  A far cry from the lime-salted tortilla chips at Grand Electric.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also opted to share the Cubeta de Camaron ($16), a 1 lb bucket of shrimp tossed in an Arbol-garlic butter, Cancun style.  These were delicious.  I liked the spices and the shrimp were grilled to a nice pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "For mains we shared the Tacos de Pescado ($14) and went with the grilled option ($1 more).  All taco dishes come with 3 tacos though you can get 4 to make it more sharable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I simply couldn't leave without an order of Churros - or could I?  In the case of Playa Cabana, I am disappointed to say I could've skipped dessert. My expectation of an airy Churro rolled in cinnamon sugar was nowhere to be found.  Instead, a nightmare of a hard and overly sweet stick (which was probably re-fried) showed up on my plate.  Suffice it to say that this was one (rare) occasion where I didn't finish dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our meal came up to about $69 net of tip.  While I really enjoyed the bucket of shrimp and the tacos were delicious and fresh; as a whole Grand Electric is still my favourite joint when I'm in the mood for Mexican.  The weak points of my meal here were definitely the guac and the Churros.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had a margarita that did not contain simple syrup.(can't remember the name, but it is the second on the margarita list)  It was tart and delicious.  BTW this is an authentic style place, so there are no frozen margaritas.  This suited me just fine.  It's not summer anymore!\n",
      " \n",
      "The tacos are a la carte, and where this differs from a little place in Mexico is that they are priced at $6, instead of $1... So much for authenticity, lol. \n",

      "Playa Cabana is a Mexican restaurant in Toronto open for lunch and dinner near the popular Yorkville area. They have three locations but I frequent original the 111 Dupont location.There are a few really great Mexican restaurants in Toronto but what I love about Playa Cabana is that it isn't a nutritional death sentence. There are quite a few pretty healthy options that are delicious and filling. The food is fresh and well priced. They also have a great tequila selection and delicious homemade chips. The space is small and cosy and in the summer they have a small patio in the back.\n",
      "The burrito is big enough to share and I would recommend sharing a little bit of everything. Their ceviche is always fresh and bursting with citrus. The brisket tacos are incredible but very heavy. This is a great place for a fun group dinner, boozy brunch or casual dinner. Strongly recommend getting a reservation.\n",

We were a group of 8 and got seats because we went early at 6pm. The ambience was good. A little dim, but that is perfect for a social gathering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food:  We did not know what to get and asked our waiter for recommendations. He was very patient and told us the popular dishes, while explaining how each is cooked. I got the Tacos Al Pastor upon his suggestion. The pork was marinated overnight and slowly cooked. It was very good and very flavourful, although the portion was not very big. I also ordered the Mojito Cubana. Not the best mojito I tried, and was a bit on the sour side. My advice, skip the mojitos.\n",

It's full of juicy, good quality beef, black beans, and rice. I've never seen any burrito would give me that much beef though! And they drizzled two different sauces, gives the burrito two totally different taste. Very entertaining!\n",

The tacos were really good too although for the price the portion was kind of small. We had churros for dessert and it wasn't that amazing but it wasn't disappointing either. The waitor was alright not amazing customer service.\n",

For Bocaditos we ordered the holy coupling of Guaca Fresca along with Fresh Salsa both served in lava rock molcajete bowls.  Eating guac and salsa this good and piquantly fresh, it was hard not to take advantage of refills for the delightfully crisp hand-pressed tortilla chips.  \n",

Mmmmmm, so far I can say these are the best fish tacos I've ever had with just the right ratio of light crumbly crisp batter encasing mouthwatering Tilapia.  My girlfriend ordered the day special of a three taco sampler of chicken, carnitas and brisket and was literally gasping between bites whilst singing their savoury praises.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there's one complaint I have it is that Playa's space is tiny so seating (especially the front area) is pretty cramped and the place fills up real fast so if you get a chance try to book yourself a reservation online to ensure a spot http:\\/\\/rez.urbanspoon.com\\/reservation\\/start\\/3991?source=selfhost\n",

      "That said, you could immediately feel the warmth and coziness of Playa (from herein called PC). I know this place is busy, so I called to make a reservation and even then we had to wait for their brand new back patio. It was definitely worth it!  Note: this was at 9 p.m. on a Monday night on a holiday weekend so if you're coming here on a weekend come very early. \n",

      "Back to the back patio: it's very cute! They've got outside heat lamps and trees that make it very intimate and the ideal second date place (good Mexican food deserves to be reserved for date deux or trois). They can also accommodate groups as well and have high tops. It works! \n",

      "Everything had plenty of accoutrements (including more guac, bestill our heart). \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was awesome--I had the beef tacos, just the right amount of food for one person.  They give you the option to add rice or a salad (but don't mention it's an extra couple of bucks--luckily, my dining companion thought to ask!), but it's not necessary at all.  The patio is lovely, and even though we didn't have a reservation, we were seated right away.  If we'd arrived later though, I'm sure we would have had to wait--by the time we left, around eight, there was a lineup on the sidewalk.\n",

      "We had the ceviche, tacos de pescado (fish), and poblano chile rellenos. The seafood in both of our dishes was incredible. It tasted extremely fresh both raw and cooked. The dishes weren't small either. We could have easily gotten full just on the mains alone. But I like to think my stomach has a 6th gear so I pushed for the ceviche up front. \n",

I was sick, so couldn't share as I normally do, but am assured that the steak burrito was pretty delicious. The shortrib taco was too though, as mentioned by the many Yelpers before me, incredibly oily. I should have heeded the warning because, after 2 tacos, the grease was too much for me and the 3rd taco was left uneaten. Still, a yummy choice for those that don't mind the oily fingers afterwards. \n",

It's not the fault of the waiters, but there has to be a better way... I can only imagine that this kind of disruption happens every day. \n",

Food remains excellent, crowd fun and we always sneak a seat at the bar rather than deal with the clunky tables.

I loved the guacamole and the spicy chicken mole was unbelievable.  We waited a few weeks to get a dinner reservation and in the end decided to try for brunch instead.  I would love to go back for dinner, but they do book in advance.  And we are fun and all, but don't normally have margaritas at brunch, so will have to take the word of other reviews about how amazing they are. \n",

Nachos and salsa for starters, both made on site and both excellent.  I had chicken enchiladas, with black bean curd and rice, my friend had Octopus tacos (yep!).  Both were excellent.

      "We boldly rolled up to Playa Cabana with no reservations.  Group of 4.  One of my friends had had dreams of tacos the previous night, so we were willing to wait it out to address her subconscious culinary cravings.  While kicking around the front patio (there's little room at the bar inside, and the front patio has yet to secure a liquor license, so it was a lot of sweating, foot shuffling, and debating how hot we'd want our guacamole as we stood around) we made friends with those waiting around us.  Consensus?  Playa Cabana is worth the wait.\n",

      "When we made it in (victorious!) we were led through the restaurant.  It's a tight space, and certainly not the most convenient flow.  Blame my overheated body, but A\\/C felt nonexistent.  Solution?  PITCHER OF MARGARITAS POR FAVOR (we opted for the tequila and orange mix).\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was simultaneously frenetic and casual, which in a way really suited the place.  Our server was really friendly, smiled with a twinkle in his eye when we ordered the guacamole spicy (it lived up to its name) and was as attentive as he could be given the many tables and the extremely tight space (which really means, I guess: he wasn't easy to locate, but we were having so much fun that it didn't really matter).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food-wise we tackled the (grilled) Baja-style fish tacos and the crispy chicken tacos, rounding off the order with some churros for dessert.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The guacamole, served in a molcajete, was predominantly smooth with a few chunks and some heat.  The accompanying chips were canola oil fried house-made corn tortillas.  They were on the greasier side, but I'm saying that...as a positive thing.\n",
      "The fish tacos were fresh, and light, and flavourful, with the softness of the fish set against the crunch of the slaw.\n",
      "The crispy chicken tacos were messier (I had to resort to my knife and fork) but the crispy shell was the perfect complement to the soft free-range chicken\n",

Fresh salsas, locally sourced dairy, free range chicken, and black and pinto beans cooked in veggie stock (the latter are re-seared with lean pork stock so don't stay vegetarian throughout the process).  Healthy tastes delicious here.  \n",

      "We were driving back from a cottage in Brighton and wanted to pick up food to eat at home. You know, avoid having to make food when we're already so tired? Playa Cabana was on our way and it's one of those spots that we've wanted to try out, but just haven't gotten to.\n",
      "We popped in and ordered the chicken and pastor (soft) tacos and a horchata for while we waited on our order.\n",
      "I found the service to be friendly and overall efficient and extremely fast. The food was done before we even got through half the drink. The horchata, while good, was not as great as we've had elsewhere in the city. I found that it was at once refreshing going down the throat but leaving your mouth with a dry feeling (which made you think you were thirsty).\n",
      "Later when we got home to eat, the shells were coming apart a bit (likely from condensation) but the meat was amazing. The pastor is a bit spicy but delicious and the chicken balanced out the spiciness of our meal.\n",
      "While there, we discussed how the location was compact which created a sense of intimacy, but it wasn't romantic in the classic sense, making it a great spot for new dates. We will return to dine in someday, and hopefully have a chance to visit the other Playa locations, to be able to compare all of them!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Walked in between the lunch time & dinner time rush and immediately got seated at our table. While the place is quite cramped, it had that semi-cozy & loud cantina feel that I felt for a minute that I was in a busy cantina somewhere in Mexico!\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a pitcher of the \"amber\" margarita, crab cakes, chicken tinga tostadas, grilled fish tacos and the tres leches cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crab cakes were on the small side, yet really appetizing that led  us to crave for more of what's to come. Both the chicken tinga tostadas (2 pcs) and the grilled fish tacos (3 pcs) were really really fresh and tasty. I also liked their variation of chili sauces on the table (chopped fresh chilies, chili chipotle, red and green sauces), and yes they were indeed HOT - which were perfect to complement any dish you order. The highlight of the meal was the amazing tres leches cake - satisfyingly moist, decadent, and refreshing all at the same time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the food looked like they were not much portion-wise, but don't let that deceive you. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have an amazingly tasty and authentic food with great ambience, it'll make you forget you're stil in the city!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We got takeout from this place a while back. Overall, I quite enjoyed the food. It would be a 5 star place if their prices where maybe 20-25% lower. We ordered the following items:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS\n",
      "This was pretty tasty but very messy to eat. Sauce and grease everywhere. I would order it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "- POLLO MILANESA CHIPOTLE BURRITO\n",
      "This was really good. Better than the tacos IMO.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm a Texan and my girlfriend is from San Diego, so we know good Mexican when we eat it, and this is excellent Mexican. The dishes were fresh and authentic, and I can't recommend the Margaritas highly enough. Splurge a little and try some of the more expensive blends - seriously the best margaritas I've ever had.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Was a humid evening and we decided to sit on the patio. We were lucky to get the best seats on the patio, without any wait. That's surprising given how small the place is and that we had not made reservations. Each of us got a drink and we decided to try the home made salsa  and guacamole. \n",
      "\n",
      "We get our drinks and the apps and are having a good conversation. 5 minutes later, to our terrible luck, it starts pouring. We ask the server if he could move us to a table inside. The place is an converted home, so I'm worried we won't be seated for a while. Meanwhile, couple of my friends barely moved. Yes, the salsa was that good. Spectacular to say the least. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our server moved us inside within 5 minutes and we didn't complain. We placed orders and the food took about 15-20 minutes. The server spoke highly of the baja fish tacos, but I was a little disappointed. I think it could have used some more flavor. The chicken tacos were surprisingly better. One of my friends got the huevos rancheros which was an enormous portion and was quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a great experience. Will definitely go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Having heard nothing but great things, and with my foodie boyfriend in town for only one more night, I knew this was our best bet for a date night. We called several times earlier in the day, but couldn't get through. After booking a reservation elsewhere, I called one last time. I was told they had 48 requests for reservations overnight and a table was unlikely. They sensed my disappointment and offered to wait list us and call if something came up. An hour later they called with availability for 2. Yesss!\n",
      "We arrived early and ordered a margarita while we waited for our table. The hostess recommended the Amber Margarita, it was a great choice If your looking to stick to the classics, not too sweet. One was enough. \n",
      "Now seated and keeping with our preference of asking waiters for recommendations, we ordered Guacamole Fresca and Ceviche of the Day (Marlin) as apps and Ancho Braised Brisket Tacos for him and Chile Rellenos for me. \n",
      "Our eyes were exceedingly bigger than our bellies. Next time we will share an entrée, or skip the apps altogether, but wanting to explore the menu as much as possible, we ordered and took a doggie bag for the next days lunch. \n",
      "The guacamole was good... fresh, flavorful and not too garlicky. The medium heat was more like mild, next time I'll give the hot a try. \n",
      "The ceviche was a little disappointing. Coming off a trip to San Francisco where I had excellent ceviche at Fresca for the first time, my standards were maybe a bit high. The blend was fresh and citrusy, with a great kick of heat. I would have preferred if the fish was more tender and not chopped into the same small cubes as everything else in the mix. Also, it might be because I got my tortilla fill on the guac, but I would have preferred the ceviche was served with plantain chips for variation. \n",
      "The tacos were some of the best I've had. Smokey and tender meat filled the flaky, soft shells. Served with their delicious seasoned rice, crema and salsa, it was the perfect Mexican meal. At least until we tried the oaxacan cheese stuffed rellenos. Breaded, fried, and placed on top of creamy tomato sauce, it was mouthwatering. With the rice, guac and salsa at its side, it was the perfect mix of flavours and textures. The only problem with this entree is that it made me regret ordering the apps because I could only have a few bites before feeling completely stuffed. \n",
      "I cannot wait to go back, intentionally order less, so I can fully enjoy my entire meal while it's hot and fresh. Service was good. The vibe is casual and cool, mixed with authentic Mexican decor.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for my sister's birthday with a group of her friends, note: this is not a place for large group (ie. anything more than 2 people).\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was good.  Fresh ingredients, good size portions, flavourful, simple and made with love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was attentive, polite and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a tequila bar, so don't expect a wide selection of scotch or vodka.  Their cocktails are creative and bring out the different tequila flavours. \n",
      "\n",
      "The space is where they lack and the \"intimate\" setting just gets annoying.   Because of proximity to everything else in the restaurant, it gets loud and it was hard to maneuver around especially since there was a group of us.  So if you're claustrophobic, wait till you get a seat on the patio. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, it's a bit pricey, but affordable considering the area.  It's about $8 for a plentiful side of guacamole and chips and $13 for tacos.  Which as I'll say again and again in my review of taco places- is too much for street food. \n",
      "\n",
      "Parking is difficult, street parking only, but the subway is about 2 blocks away.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you're looking for a spin on Mexican food, this is the place! Hidden gem , would highly recommend. The only downside to my experience here is the location, it is EXTREMELY tight. I am not usually one to complain for small intimate restaurants, but this place is just too small for comfort.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is really quaint mexican joint with amazingly fresh food, one of the best in Toronto. My favorites are the guac to start, then fish tacos, short rib tacos, the corn and a mojito wash it down. The tres leches cake is to die for.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have room  I would recommend trying the different catch of the day. If you see Lobster tacos on the specials menu ....ORDER IT!\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure you try and make reservations or be prepared to wait some time for a table but it's totally worth it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm a big fan of Milagro as it was formerly the only real Mexican food I had access to, so I'm really happy Playa Cabana has opened up. The menu is divided up into appetizers, tacos, burritos, and house specials, that includes entrees that don't fit into the other categories, such as huevos rancheros, tostadas, and carne asada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guacamole and nachos reminded me of Milagro, but with the option to add spice to it. Honestly though, I like Milagro's guac better, first because they give you a larger portion and second, at Playa Cabana I couldn't taste the other flavours in the guac too much, possibly because we ordered it spicy. The nachos were awesome though, and still warm from the oven (or more likely, the fryer).\n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered the chorizo sausage which was smothered in the best tasting sauce I've ever had.  The whole table was dipping their nachos in the sauce after the chorizo was done.  The sausage itself was pretty lean, and I'm a fan of fatty meat, but for a lean sausage, it was pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taco dishes come with three small tacos each for about $12. If you're hungry, get the rice and beans on the side for another $2.  The corn tortillas the tacos are made with is fresh and delicious, and the filling (I got skirt steak and chorizo) is okay. They did not disappoint me but did not stand out either.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burrito dishes are huge portions, so it feels much more satisfying to eat than the tacos.  The sauces on the burrito really made it good, and better than the tacos in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For dessert I had a spicy mole gelato that was absolutely delicious. It was rich and chocolatey with a tiny kick of spice at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "To drink, try the agave margarita.  It has orange and lime juice and no sugar, just agave nectar.  In my opinion, Playa Cabana's margaritas are perfectly made. They also have Jarritos pop and Mexican pop made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup - you actually CAN taste a difference!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend making a reservation here. The place is small, and was rammed the entire night.  I can't wait until summer when the patio is open - you will definitely find me there, sipping margaritas.\n"

      "Ordered the chips with guac (WOW it was amazing) and the bucket of shrimp to start. \n",

      "\n",
      "The ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS were the best... Hands down. The crispy shells were drenched in beef juice, the meat was soft and tender.. And it came out fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Baja Tacos, and they were good - the tortillas were not the freshest and it was a little stale. Fish tho was great and complimented well with onions, avocado and mayo (I believe). \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely would revisit this restaurant and sister restaurants...\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "In terms of success I guess the Mas Playa group of restaurants has its footing deep into Toronto's Mexican food trend obsession, growing from this Dupont Street location to several others around the city centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bit hidden off and a tad pricey for something that is essentially Mexican street foods, Playa Cabana is small, cramped, dark, lively... and zesty. Food-wise it is fresh as it get here in the cold gloomy north; quality comparable to some of the Mexican stuff I recall dabbling in whilst in Los Angeles (though I am certainly no authority of \"authentic\" Mexican food at all). But damn they big! Flavours and textures were bursting as we bit into our overstuffed (maybe way too overstuffed) tacos and tuna ceviche. Good grilled flavour in the chorizo in my taco. Fresh guac all around too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the noise I hear about how crowded it gets at dinnertime, try coming in at lunch instead.\n",
      "Of all the noise I hear about on-and-off service, my experience with the servers were generally positive and friendly.\n",

      "{TTC: a short couple blocks walk from Dupont subway station. The Bay and Dupont buses also serve the area, but bus service here really stinks.}\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is pretty popular, and it was tight getting a seat on a Friday night, but thankfully there was only two of us and small table left in the back. The atmosphere is cozy, hip and modern Mexican, sometimes, it's nice being only six inches from your neighbouring table! And I'm glad we were able to sneak in, because everything was fabulous. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started off the meal with homemade chips and salsa. I wish there was an endless bowl of each for me to munch on all day and all night. The salsa was bright and fresh with just enough heat to slap your tongue around. The chips were warm and crisp and the perfect vehicle to get the salsa to your month. Next came the chicken tostadas and ancho braise short rib tacos. The chicken tostadas came piled hight with guac and crema with some black beans thrown into the mix to give the meal some weight. The surprise of the dish though, the rice! I chased down every single grain of rice that was on that plate. The short ribs had a delicious depth of flavour that was balance by the pico de gallo. \n",
      "\n",
      "My mouth is watering while I write this review just thinking of the salsa and rice. Next time, I'm going to have to wash all that delicious food down with a margarita!\n",

      "Plaaaaaaya caaaabana you are so tiny and adorable!\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid 4! It takes some time to get a rezzy for this place but it was worth it. I went with my hubby and some girlfriends and was surprised at how tiny this place was. It's in a residential area and it's actually a house which I loved. \n",
      "\n",
      "We shared a lot of dishes...but let's start with drinks. I had a rum mojito which was awesome (my fav drink after all) and my hubby had the bacon infused bourbon sour which was aaaawesome. He then had a Mexican iced tea which was strong and delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: We started with crab cakes, chorizo, flautas. The crab cakes were amazeeee and the flautas were crispy, creamy, tangy. Just really good. The chorizo was ok. Nothing amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "For mains we basically had burritos which were authentic but not mind blowing. To finish we shared churros  oh yes! I love these babies. Warm, gooey, with a bite. Mmmmm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good. We got a lot of attention (it helps that the resto has like 10 tables and there was 3-4 servers) but still very appreciated. It is loud but not so much that you can't socialize. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I might go back but there's still so many more places to see!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "4 out of 5! Cute concept! Friendly staff with passion for tequila! Portions are huge so worth sharing! Very flavourful and authentic\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I absolutely love this place! Playa Cabana is tucked away from the main hustle and bustle of downtown (yet is still close by) so you feel as if you discovered a local joint that only the who's who knows about. The restaurant is on a quiet street among homes and there is a really cute patio in front that you can imagine being packed on a hot summers day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside is so cozy and charming that you know you're just going to love the place. But the food is so yummy and BIG and satisfying. The burrito's are MONSTER and the length of one full arm so beware of food-coma after. The ceviche is refreshing and light and perfect for sharing. I had the Chile Relleno which is one of my favorite Mexican dishes: fried pepper (with egg batter) with cheese and glorious filling inside. YUM!\n",
      "It doesn't matter how full you are, the Tres Leche cake is divine. Rich, moist cake topped with whipped cream (O.M.G!) Must have no matter what.\n",

      "This place was packed when my friends arrived and people just kept on coming. There are two tables for larger groups and a couple of smaller tables at the front of the restaurant. We were told we had a two hour seating limit which was fine (any longer and we would have snoozed at our tables).\n",

      "\n",
      "I ordered the mexican cherizos tacos, which came with deep fried tacos. The menu was excellent, except for the greasy nature of the tacos themselves. I tried the carnita on soft tacos, definitely well cooked meat with lots of flavour.\n",

      "Definitely a nice nook with very good Mexican food and excellent ambiance!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nice little place for lunch or dinner. Great guac and tacos, although the space is a bit tight and it's hard to get a table. If it weren't so busy I'd be back more often. Service at the bar was a great experience for dinner.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Burritos are massive and very yummy.  I also enjoyed the lime margaritas. Fun back patio area but a but loud and tight.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great atmosphere - I love coming here with my friends and sharing guacamole with a variety of tacos.  Last time I came, I ordered the fish taco (fried) and pork sausage with roasted pineapple taco.  Loved the fish taco (meaty and flaky), but felt the pork sausage was overly salty, though the pineapples were a nice touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pricing seems reasonable (3 tacos starting at $15). I thought the cocktails were overpriced ($13 and up), and did not order any.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was told by my friends that this is one of the best Mexican restaurants for tacos. I checked it out today and I can say that it is indeed pretty good. In the summer they have an awesome patio, which is always packed. Even though it's kinda small, the atmosphere is very intimate. Their mojito is one of the best in Toronto and they make it with either rum or tequila. I tried a tequila-based mojito and it was a little sour, but tasted pretty good. Their tacos are $13 for 3. They're tasty and well worth the trip. However, my #1 choice for tacos would still be Barrio Coreano located at 642 Bloor Street West. I give Playa Cabana a solid 4-star rating because they totally deserve it. Next time, I'll make sure to check out Playa Cabana Hacienda.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The good: Housemade corn chips. Tasty, fresh guac. Zesty beverage (Playa Paloma). Friendly, efficient service. Tacos de pescado. Insanely spicy hot sauce. Monster sized slice of tres leches cake. B-list Canadian celebrity sighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bad: Incredibly cramped seating.\n",

Pho Linh is a small vietnamese restaurant located at College and Dufferin; a little cluster of vietnamese shops and restaurants in the midst of the surrounding portuguese enclave. Recently renovated, Pho Linh delivers one of the better Pho's in downtown Toronto. It's money baby!\n",
      "\n",
      "Broth: lightly coloured, but sweet and rich in flavor. not overly salty, unlike other places in town. soup comes garnished with a healthy topping of scallions and cilantro always a pleasant sight to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noodles: slightly wider but I think it's because these are actually fresh rice noodles instead of the typical rice sticks used-they taste uberly fresh too. the only FRESH noodles I've come across amongst the pho joints downtown!\n",
      "\n",
      "Herb plate: saw and basil on hand; definite plus and lime wedge. more places should offer saw though not a dealbreaker for me so long as the broth is on point\n",

Delish! The thin, delicate rice flour sheets add a melt in your mouth contrast to the savory filling and the fried shallots provide a pleasant pop on top. \n",

      "The rest of the menu is extensive-bun, broken rice and specialty soups are available as well and the prices are in keeping with most vietnamese joints around town. But man!

Unlike many other restos, there is a very generous amount of filling (ground pork and mushroom) in each roll and it's so flavourful! We also order the spring roll and bo kho (spicy stew beef) which wasn't spicy all. It had a very tasty broth that has been simmered with carrots and very very tender beef cubes. Just thinking about it makes it want to go back for another bowl tomorrow.\n",

First off, don't come here with any vegetarians, as they have little to no selection for veggie pho. At most pho places I order the Rare beef \\/ beef ball rice noodle. It came very quick and I was so impressed with the noodle to meet ratio. I've been severely let down by most places around Toronto for this reason. Too much broth not enough good stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "The broth was delicious right to the end and the amount of meat was amazing. I'd say this is one of the better if not best pho places in Toronto. However two things threw me off (hence the not so perfect score) - There was not a mini dish to fill a little rooster sauce mix to dip the meat into, so I used one of the spoons. There was a fruit fly in the ice cold tea (since it's hot out now). Kinda a bummer, but the delicious pho stands true.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What the heck did I eat here? I'm drawing a blank on the viet name already, but it was S3 (special #3) which is only served on Monday-Thursday. \n",

      "It was a stew with spicy broth, roasted carrots and big pieces of stewed beef. Noodles were thick. Beef and broth were delicious, a bit fatty but that's what makes it tasty. I didn't like the noodles\\/broth ratio, way too many noodles and not enough broth! mmm broth\n",

In short, get in and out, but definitely get in because if you really like Phó, the flavours are fantastic!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place pho is very good. Their pho broth is good. Price is inexpensive. The place is very small and loud. This is not a good place if you want to relax and enjoy your meal. When they are very busy, there will a line out the door. Avoid going in the weekends and lunch hours.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here is very delicious! Like many other people said its like a no-frills restaurant cash only! One time I had to pay for my friend so don't forget! But overall I would rate 4 stars. Plus I play basketball near here so it is a very nice place to go after a workout like that!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was probably my favourite pho place in Toronto as they use fresh noodle and ingredients.  The place seems like it had been undergone renovation recently so it looks more comfy dining in.  Their weekend special is bun bo hue which is always my favour.  But during my last visit I feel some components are missing such as coagulated pig blood and bun bo hue itself still tastes delicious but more of satay flavour.  I didn't taste much of shrimp paste in the soup as well.  The pho itself is still my favour in Toronto, the broth is light and perhaps not as flavourful as pho at Thinh Thanh, but they use flat rice noodle unlike many other places in Toronto that use dry vermicelli type.  Another item worth mentioning is pho bo kho, very very flavourful and yummy.  But they only serve that btw Mon-Thu.\n",

I wouldn't go out of my way to return as I do have other favourite pho places in the city however if I was in the area I definitely would stop by!\n",

      "I love this place, one of my favorites in the West end. I like that their noodles a little wider and fresh. They are pretty quick, and the broth is consistent. For those of you who enjoy their soup on the spicier side, they have a couple chilli oil jars kicking around. which is a big bonus for me, seeing as i bring my own sometimes to pho places that don't have them. i'm pretty much a regular there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After hearing raving reviews from my friends, I had to come try this place out. Apparently they're known for their bun bo hue and their banh cuon. And today I was craving a hot bowl of noodles so I decided to come here and see what my friends were talking about. My cousin and i came here around 4pm and already a lot of tables were occupied. We ended up getting a table by the window. I opened the menu and the first thing I saw was the bun bo hue (it's a weekend special fri-sun). So we ordered that plus the banh cuon. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the banh cuon arrived, I was so excited to try it. I've never had it before but it's like rice roll with pork. The rice roll itself is very thin and is sticky and when dipped into fish sauce...heaven! The bun bo hue tasted a bit different but in a good way. At other places it had too much of a lemongrass flavour to it. But this was different, there was a subtle taste of lemongrass plus other flavours. This was also spicy! I'm glad I tried this place out. I heard their other pho are amazing as well and I'd definitely come back again.\n",

      "They take cash* only!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's the best Pho restaurant in the area, so I highly recommend coming here if you're near. It's pretty small inside, so expect to wait for a table during prime eating hours. I believe they only accept cash. People come here because their food is of good value (tasty yet not too expensive). Their decor is nothing to write home about. I believe the restaurant is named after a Vietnamese singer, who happens to be the owner's sister. There is free parking on the surrounding side streets, or paid meter parking on College Street.\n",

      "\n",
      "The food came quite fast; about 4 minutes after I ordered. I liked the broth and the beef ingredients, but the noodles were a little overcooked and broke apart quite easily.

I got the Hue style beef pho instead, which is their weekend offering.\n",

I definitely prefer a more robust noodle, so they score points here.  The side of sprouts, basil, limi, and a chili was very generous... which is good, because I usually have to ask for more.\n",

      "The banh cuon (I think that's the name) isn't normally my style, but it was good.  The odd little muffin thing topped with a fried shimp was damned tasty (I didn't bother with the shrimp... it was desiccated, though had served its purpose by imparting mucho flavour).  \n",

      "I have come to realize, however, that I'm just not a fan of Vietnamese style sausage... at least not the spongy, starchy kind served here (and many other places).  They taste good, sure, but it just ain't meat.  I'd feel the same way if I was served a hotdog on the side.\n",

Not only is it my culture's food, but I have been surrounded by viet mothers who secretly cook competitively against each another my whole entire life. When I go out to have Vietnamese food, I don't expect a lot, I just expect it to be quick and tasty enough that I wouldn't pause and re think whether or not I want to take another bite.  I've heard a few things about pho linh and their infamous homemade banh pho. After having their bowl of pho, I can see what the rage is all about.  The banh pho is great, it tasted fresh and had the right amount of chewiness and matched perfectly well with the savory sweet soup. I also ordered the banh beo, which consists of small steamed rice cakes topped with chopped dried shrimp, scallions, mung bean paste, crispy fried shallots and nuoc mam (fish sauce). The texture of the banh beo was flawless, it wasn't soft and nor was it powdery (I've actually had banh beo made like this and it was not pleasant), I figured that if the banh pho was made well that the banh beo would come to par. Definitely a great Vietnamese establishment!\n"

Really good flavour on the broth, although I agree with other posters that this is not one where the typical spices of anise and cardamom sing. Well rounded and meaty, it was still the perfect comfort food. I skipped my usual condiments doctoring, because it really didn't need it; the salt levels are bang on. While I didn't eat in, I did scope out the space. Not 100% clean, but not disturbingly dirty either.

Their pho was also good biggest test is the thirst test and they passed. I didn't feel the urge to drink 5 glasses of water the next morning.  The restaurant is family style and it seats a comfortable number of people.\n",

      "I had pho with beef and tendons while my friend had the bun vermicelli noodles. The broth was delicious of course. Really, I should learn to make pho because I like it do much. And they had avocado shake which I love. There isn't much on service as this is very much a bare bones type of place. You even write down your own orders. And it's cash only. But the food is very good and they don't rush you out. I'd recommend this and would go back again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had my first great banh cuon experience at Pho Linh and ever since I can remember, I've only ordered banh cuon take out from here. They make it real good serving up big portions where they generously give larger fillings of minced pork and mushroom into each roll. This dish is very satisfying as it is cheap so it'll give you a run for your money! They also have a variety of genuine Vietnamese drinks that should be tried since you might not find them at any other Vietnamese restaurants such as che ba mau, suong sao etc. since the make time is a bit tedious. Spring rolls are also a must get appetizer as they are made crunchy with a delicious meat filling. My mouth is watering just talking about it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "Although I find that the beef that they used were quite fatty, the speed of things that came after ordering was pretty fast. Bonus points for an impatient person like me! The weekday special beef stew is a must try as the broth is flavourful, deep and rich. Almost reminds me of an Ox Tail base soup.\n",

      "The Hue style rice cakes are also a must not miss dish. Its not often every Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto has this dish and does it well. This place is so affordable, fast and food is good.

The bun is one of the best I've ever had - a delightful combination of textures and tastes, it includes your choice of protein, cucumber, mint, lettuce, roasted peanuts, as well as a really tasty Nuoc Cham sauce with slices of pickled carrot and daikon. The Nuoc Cham seems to be the Northern Vietnam variety - less garlicy and spicy than its southern counterpart.

The noodles are a constant al dente texture. The beef is thinly sliced and of great quality. Portions are a bit small, but the ability makes up for it.

The chicken pho broth is clean and not-oily unlike some other places. Sometimes, however, when ordering the pho, they cut the chicken pieces a little too think, and these pieces are also very dry. On a more positive note, there are no weird chicken pieces, they are all breast\\/white meat. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you haven't tried it yet.\n",

I ended up ordering the Pho Bo Kho, a spicy beef stew noodle soup. Service was fast maybe because I was the only one there at 10 am. It came piping hot along with the requisite side of sprouts\\/herbs. The soup appeared oily but once you mix it around it's not that noticeable. But the taste was very flavorful. You know they took care & time to cook the broth down to this level of complexity. The rice noodles were the wide kind and soaked up the broth nicely.

      "Saved us from a Sunday night of frozen pizza! It was 9 o'clock and our options for dinner were rapidly diminishing when the Red Bowl Asian Bistro popped up on my android restaurant finder. They were open til 10 so the decision was made. Our initial greeting by what looked to be the owner of all ppl was not one of excitement  or even welcome....but the service was friendly which I suppose is what matters. We had sushi to start with, because I am a weenie eater when it comes to sushi we had a California roll, which let's face it is hard to make wrong, and a Dragon roll, which was a hit with the rest of the table.  Our table ordered the Broccoli Beef and the Cashew Chicken both of which got middle of the road responses (we didn't take these leftovers home, which speaks volumes), we also had a simple Chicken Lo Mein which was delish (with the addition of some soy sauce) and the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken that was unique and very fresh.  Another big plus were the portion sizes, we all ordered individual dishes, but there was plenty to share, which is half the fun of dining out right?  \n",
      "\n",
      "On another note, they don't serve alcohol on Sundays (sniffle), but if you bring in your church bulletin, you get a free soda (hmmmm....).\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though half of the dishes failed to rock my world, the fact that the ingredients were fresh leads me to believe that after some investigation to weed out weak dishes, you'll be left with some pretty delicious Asian options when the mood strikes!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My first experience here was poor as the wait was very long. In all fairness, they had only just opened and they were exceptionally busy and they did not have the staff to handle the demand. I went back - although I told myself I never would - as I really want this place to be good. My second visit was much better. Our server was very knowledgeable and professional and the food was good. I have updated my rating from one star to three as this represents an average of my two experiences. I'll likely go back but I'm not ready to recommend this place to out-of-town folks just yet!!!\n"

      "Drove from Columbus to eat here. My husband and I have been dying to try Wahlburgers. Food was great, service mediocre. Drinks from bar were terrible. First drink ordered they didn't have all the ingredients . Second drink tasted awful.\n",
      "Atmosphere was not impressive. Overall disappointed for the long drive for a hamburger.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place was packed when we got in; although, being new and popular I expected this. Their was a lot of front of the house staff that didn't seem too in to their jobs. They just stood their chatting and playing around with each other. There were a few tables open but they were apparently being held for other people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally another hostess came to the front and got things moving. We were seated outside, which was fine it was a nice day. However, I wish smoking wasn't allowed so close to where we were eating. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our food was good. I really enjoyed my burger but the tots were just ok. They didn't taste homemade or anything special. Our server was good as well. I might go back once the hype wears off.\n",

      "First time here and probably the last.  Met friends who came up from out of town at 2pm on a Saturday.  Was told 30-35 minute wait for a table when we got there.  25 minutes later we were seated.  Pleasantly surprised, as I had read negative reviews about longer than expected wait times.  We waited a little longer than normal for our waiter to come by, and by that time we had already looked over the menu and were ready to order, so he took our drink and food order at the same time.  Didn't have to wait too long on drinks.  Our food came out about 50 minutes after we'd been seated.  Nothing to write home about.  It wasn't horrible  but I've had better burgers.  It was an enjoyable lunch with friends I hadn't seen in a while, but next time we'll meet in the burbs with plenty of free parking.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just another burger place. Not great, but not bad either. When we first got there, they stated that the wait would be between 30 to 45 minutes. I saw about 4 or 5 tables that were not occupied. Why such a long wait when there appears to be open tables? Are they reserved? Do you not like the way I look? I wanted to ask, but I figured since a few friends are with me, I didn't want to make a scene. After about 30 minutes, we got seated. I ordered \"The Our Burger\". It had lettuce, tomato, onion, their signature wall sauce, and pickles. There wasn't too much sauce on my burger, which I appreciated. The sauce was flavorful and added a nice touch to the burger. I also ordered the Yukon gold fries, which were good. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a bar area with several flat screen TVs and seating both inside and outside. The service was poor. It must have taken over 40 minutes to receive our food from the time we ordered. Once we finished, it took awhile to receive our checks. I do not think they were appropriately staffed with the amount of customers in the restaurant. There was a concert going on at the stadium nearby, so I don't think they were quite ready. The burger market is saturated, and although the wall sauce was good, it wasn't enough to really differentiate themselves from the other burger chains. There's only so many different ways you can make a burger.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My husband chose Wahlburgers as his birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us.  We were a little nervous because there was an Indians game and a Cleveland and a concert at the Q - but our wait was only about 20 minutes. After we were seated, we ordered 4 waters WITH LEMON and a bourbon beer and sweet potato tater tots to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tater tots were absolutely delicious.  Waitress forgot the lemons, and they ran out of the beer we wanted.  They also \"ran out of cups, but got the plastic ones ones our water was served in from \"somewhere\" - a little sketchy\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, on to food, we had 3 burgers, they were good, not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.  A portabella mushroom burger, was good.  And a Mom's sloppy joe - which my mom said was good.  So over all the food was good.\n",
      "Also ordered the onion rings (which were really onion straws), but in my opinion were the highlight of the dinner. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few things:\n",
      "* they didn't have lemons (despite being a restaurant and full service bar)\n",
      "* the special Wahl-sauce tasted like ketchup, mayo and water\n",
      "* the BBQ sauce tasted just like the Wahl-sauce\n",
      "* they \"ran out of cups\"\n",
      "* I don't understand the wire baskets instead of plates, plastic silverware and paper cups format - I wish it wa\n",
      "* the waitress had \"no clue\" what the feature burger was\n",
      "* the check in process was a pad of paper, which the host wrote our name and phone number - took forever \n",
      "* despite being seated within 20 minutes, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to greet us, and then about 30 minutes for the food to come to the table \n",
      "* everything was ala carte - so the $9 burger, plus $3.50 side was pretty expensive for \"average\"  especially if you want a \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I think it was good - and hopefully because it's new they are going through growing pains, and once they get their ordering system up and running, as well as fully trained staff (our waitress was not knowledgeable of anything and kept using the phrase \"I have no clue\") things will get better!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pretty good burger, but I'm not a burger connoisseur. The tots and onion rings were good. I'd like to go back and try the fries. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is just a burger joint. Don't expect a huge menu with a lot of options, especially vegetarian.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had to try this place because of Mark Wahlberg and the TV show but the food was nothing special. Average burger and fries. Cleveland definitely has better burgers. Townhall or Flipside or Harry Buffalo come to mind\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Fine I guess.  Nothing special at all. I hope it goes out of biz and is replaced with a shake shack. Service was fine but maybe weird. Burger was slop on a bun.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "There was a lot of hype surrounding Wahlburgers and I was excited to try their food. I felt the burger was average. Their special sauce on the burger was nice, but it didn't really set it apart from any other burger place. I didn't care for the fries, but that is just my personal preference as my husband loved the fries. I like slimmer more crispy fries, but I will say the food was fresh and brought out hot. I would visit again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. The service was good and our food came out quickly during lunch time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was excellent, customer service however was not. Our waitress of the name Jenny was not charismatic and got both our burgers wrong. Didn't seem interested in us at all. For such a family oriented establishment this seemed surprising to me. You can get better service at Chipotle tbh. Prior to dining in, we had to call because we missed the sign and wanted to make sure we were in the right place, and the person on the phone had an attitude when I asked saying that it's obviously the restaurant with Wahlburgers on the front, great food, sucky service.\n",

      "We ended up there before an Browns game and it ended up being packed. End of August the weather was still a bit warm, inside was nice and air conditioned but we ended up sitting in the back outside of the bar. BIG mistake. I thought i was gonna die of overheating. Not sure why they had an outside bar area and didnt think to put some fans out there for circulation jesus. Even the poor bartender was sweating bullets, her shirt literally soaked. She was nice through it all though, however, the way the bar is situated it had seats on the end near where the other waiters\\/waitresses do the checks and you can overhear the horrid conversations some of the staff have. For example, on this particular day, they were getting packed and this waitress with blonde hair and some tatts was blatantly saying \" i wish these f*king people would leave my table i cant deal with them anymore\" and then she started talking about her fellow employees to another employee and they were very rude and open about it. The manager needs to address her ASAP.\n",

      "The burger, i ended up getting a fiesta burger medium well and some onion rings.\n",
      "The burger was a little on the rare side for me, i purposely asked for medium well but they fell short on the mark. The burger was decent, a bit sloppy for me, the bun got soggy from the salsa, the cheese wasnt fully melted it was kind of a slop. The onion rings were the highlight, a single order is enough to feed two, and it comes with this awesome dipping sauce. We were engaged with some hand crafted beer from local brewerys which was awesome because now i have a new beer to guzzle lol. The waitress again was nothing short of awesome, despite her burning behind the bar she maintained a smile and did her job perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of things for the owners\\/manager:\n",
      "\n",
      "If your staff isnt happy theres a quick fix, find new staff. Get fans for the outdoor bar area because newsflash if they are sitting outside its most likely summertime. Teach your cooks the difference between rare and cooked because thats a health code violation waiting to happen and PLEASE consider your seating arrangements. it was a bit tight in the actual inside dining area, almost impossible to pass people.\n"

      "I was very happy when Cleveland finally got a Wahlburgers so I had high hopes going in.  My father and sister had just went here a couple weeks prior to my visit and had a wonderful visit and my Dad said his burger was the best he's ever had. We went on a Saturday early evening and we were seated right away. Our waiter Dwayne was the best part of our whole experience. He was very nice, fun, efficient and went above what most waiters do. Three of us ordered well done burgers and specifically asked that we did not want any pink whatsoever. When our burgers came out 2 of them were not only pink but had blood coming out. Our waiter was very upset by them also having one of the burgers wrongly ordered by having lettuce on it when asked without but also because 2\\/3 were pink and bloody. Management wanted to discount the burgers that we didn't even touch instead of taking them off the check completely which was a joke. What food establishment DISCOUNTS food you don't eat that THEY screw up instead of removing it from your check? We asked to speak to management and they sent out their little manager not the head honcho. The worker seemed a bit nervous and scared I'm not sure why but as if he would be in trouble even though it wasn't his fault. They need new chefs working there if they want some more business. Dwayne was an excellent waiter he was personable, kind and very apologetic even though it wasn't his fault but the chefs. Management did end up taking the burgers off the check but that was after us requesting to speak to him. I'm not completely sure I would go back after this experience if I do it would be because the staff made us feel at home not because of the cooking. Get some new cooks in the back who know how to cook up a burger and who can follow some simple directions. Don't let the Wahlburgers name go down in the dumps just because of some crappy chefs.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Burger spot. No just kidding, it's a burger spot. But it is well known. Good thing is there are some good burgers here. The sizes of the burgers are perfect. My wife and I ate at the exterior bar. This is why they are receiving 3 stars. It was hot the day we went and over the bar there aren't any fans. I can't knock whoever built the place, because they may not have known that the area in downtown isn't the most windy. They're on Ontario, prospect is basically the wind tunnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "The interior is bright. The indoor bar is large with plenty of tables to seat plenty of hungry individuals. The wait time when we went was no existent. Around the interior there are plenty of posters, all wahlburg branded of course. Movie posters for Mark, you know. It's right under the jack so you can either enter or exit right from an elevator straight from the jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that out of the way, let's speak on service and food. Our bartender was delightful. She understood the heat and gave us water without us even saying anything. She was thorough and attentive. Walburgers has a simple menu, not too large or small. This is a good thing. The negative is that fries are not a standard side. They make up by having large sides that you purchase separately that can be shared between two people. That's what my wife and I did. We ordered our 2 burgers and split their crispy onion rings, which were a HUGE helping for the price. Speaking on the onion \"rings\" they weren't rings, they were more like crispy shreds. They breading on them was delicious though. I'd never thought I'd like onion shreds outside of a burger but they were definitely done right. This is once again where the bartender came in and helped, we both ordered the onion rings, she quickly told us that we'd definitely only need one serving as it ended up being a large basket. I'd even say 3 people could share them if they get larger burgers. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the burgers themselves. They're definitely flavorful. I ordered the double decker. Which is a classic burger, the veggies were crisp and fresh, the bun was delicious. I haven't seen others reviews or why wahlburgers is getting a bad rap unless it's because of the outdoor bar. The food is good , I've had better burgers elsewhere, but these burgers definitely lived up to the hype.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Seated with a larger group right away on a Saturday in a nice spot on their spacious patio. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the fiesta burger and it was delicious! Only complaint would be all the sauce is laid on the bottom bun, so the burger gets a little soggy and may fall apart. Our table also got onion straws\\/rings to share and they were incredible, gone in probably 5 min. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was excellent for everyone, HOWEVER, can't see myself wanting to go back due to service. Our waiter was awful. Silence when we ordered, never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. That was the most surprising. Wait for our food was pretty lengthy but not crazy. \n",
      "\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came in before the Indians\\/dodgers game. Seated right away outside and greeted by the server. Took our beverage orders and returned with them. We then placed our food order. The next time we had a table visit was almost 25 minutes later. Food almost took 45 minutes to come out. Got a total of 4 visits from the server including dropping the bill off. Maybe come back after they weed out some of the employees. Only nice part on this visit was the outdoor seating. That's why I'm giving this 3 stars.\n",

      "Go with Med-to hot spicy. Casual ambiance. But fresh food. Good prices. My total was $35. That's almost 3 meals.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We ordered takeout from here and wasn't disappointed. They were very fast and friendly when we picked it up. My husband ordered sweet basil which could've used quite a bit more basil. I ordered spicy fried rice and it was very good. The prices we reasonable. Our bill was less than $20. This is definitely a family-owned restaurant which I really liked. They had a cute little bar in their with a great selection of Asian beers. Next time I go I will eat in so I can try some!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ordered (for delivery) chicken satay, tom yum soup and pad si-ew.  All of it are so delicious!  I would have given it 5 star but I asked for extra sauce on the pad si-ew but I didn't get it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I admit I'm not a big fan of going to grungy area. Don't get me wrong the restaurant itself is clean and reasonably comfortable. I just prefer to be in an area that take cares of its surrounding. \n",
      "\n",
      "In any case I gave this place a 4\\/5 stars solely because of the Thai food they offered and customer service. Before I started plant based diet, I used to get their BBQ chickens. They were DELICIOUS! Also they have a tasty Thai tea here. It's very sweet though to if you are avoiding sugar it's probably not your thing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great food, good service, a little pricey but will definitely come back. Unlike other Thai joints, they actually check on you & refill your water here which is so nice! The 4 instead of 5 stars is because the waiter kept asking me if I was sure I wanted a spicy dish (I know, I know - I look too white to be able to handle spice but I love it!) and after I convinced him yes, the dish wasn't spicy at all and I HATE when they do that! I appreciate they're trying to protect me but they need to trust me when I order spicy. Food still had great flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My wife and I went to Bangkok Thai on a weekday afternoon, the place was quiet and low key. As we walked in, the hostess was very friendly. My wife had the Mighty Masaman Curry, and I had the spicy cat fish recommended by another yelper. Both dishes were delicious. The curry sauce was thick, creamy, coconutty and flavorful it went well with the potatoes and chicken. The cat fish was awesome, I'm not sure what the batter it was fried in was but I loved the fact that it wasn't greasy flavored or textured. The sauce that went with the cat fish was kinda sweet and a bit spicy depending on the level of spiciness you choose. We had coconut ice cream with fried bananas in a wonton as our dessert and those were pretty good too.\n",

      "Vegetarian Review...\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, So since 1-1-2013 I went vegetarian and have been rating the places I like and cater to the vegetarian and vegan who wants good food and a place their meat eating friends can enjoy too. So I was in the mood for some Tom Kha soup and something I hadn't tried before. I ordered the Tom Kha, mild and wished I had gone for the medium...a little too westerned down for one who likes a little bite back. I also got the Buddhist Garden (which they do offer with meat as well or tofu)...very tasty! I am trying to figure out why the place was empty on a Saturday night...I'm figuring it's new and hasn't been discovered yet. But if you live on the west side and want some very good Thai this place delivers....just be prepared to pay $5.99 for that delivery...better to just go and pick it up...worth it too. Would have been 5 stars if the veges had been just a LITTLE LESS COOKED...NOT SOGGY BUT NOT QUITE CRISP AS I LIKE THEM.\n"

For me it had all the right flavors going on. My husband had the sweet basil with beef.

      "The pineapple chicken curry was pretty good at a reasonable price.  I was disappointed that all of the other curries incorporate the exact same vegetables (including a poisonous plant called \"zucchini\"), but the pineapple curry uses a different mix.  The vegetables DID seem like they had been frozen, and there were no fresh herbs, so that's why I didn't give them the fifth star.  The punctuality, price, quantity and quality of meat, and overall flavor were quite favorable.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The lunch comes with a spring roll and cup of soup. The soup was ok but the spring roll was fresh and delicious. My Panang curry was amazing! I got it very mild and it still had a slight spice which is exactly how I like it. The Pad Thai seemed a little bland to me but my fiancé preferred it to others that he has had that had a little more sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is off the beaten path and tucked away in a complex but if you like Thai food I would recommend seeking it out and giving this place a try!\n",

I navigated here with her and 4 mutual friends, whom after a long day in the pool, needed some sustenance. \n",
      "The waitress was super friendly, it probably helped that 3 of my friends had recently visited Thailand and had plenty to talk with her about. \n",
      "We had the place all to ourselves. Very cozy. Excited to share our meal \"family style\" we ordered some wonton soup and the fisherman's platter, thai iced teas, and the coconut pineapple fried rice-A MUST. In addition we ordered sweet and sour pork, pad thai- which is the best I've ever had, and a beef dish, blanking on the exact name.\n",
      "We devoured everything, I'm sure the employees were waiting for us to lick the plates. \n",

      "\n",
      "Anyway the food is a must on flavor. The green curry is some of the best I have ever tasted. The Tom Kah was a tad greasy but so delish, and the pad thai was actually light and pleasant compared to most places where it is super over whelming.\n",

      "Stopped in here for a date night last Friday night and was fairly happy with the result.  I ordered the spicy fried rice with beef which I asked for \"hot\". My wife ordered spicy noodle dish which she ordered \"medium\".  Both dishes tasted excellent and the spicy element was perfect for both of our dishes.  The portions sizes were fairly size able for the price of the entrees (~10 each) and I had enough for leftovers which is pretty rare for me especially since it was a late dinner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The one complaint I had was with the dessert. My wife loves sticky rice, especially when the mango is in season.  After we had returned our menus we decided to get the sticky rice without looking at the price when our server told my wife they did have mango available.  The dessert itself was not bad but I was taken aback when I saw the price being about 8 dollars.  Based on the portion size this was at best worth 5 and I felt lampooned but since I didn't check the price I just paid for the meal and hope I learned my lesson for next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ordered take out for my husband and I. We ordered yellow curry, spice, and pad see wu (in not sure how you spell it). We've been going to another place off of bell and this place is a whole lot better. We're officially switching thai restaurants. The only thing is we like our food a little spicier so next to me we will ask. \n",

      "My husband said the restaurant looks clean inside although on the outside the building is run down which has nothing to do with the restaurant.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I really liked this place! It was empty when we went it, but most Thai places are around 8:00 pm. The server was really nice and gave good service. We got the spicy basil dish and the sweet and sour chicken. The spicy basil was amazing!!! You could actually taste the basil! It was delicious! On the downside, we got it at \"medium\" spicy level and it was just way too spicy. The sweet and sour chicken was ok. It could have been better. It wasn't very sweet, it was more sour. So I got a side of the sweet sauce and that made it better. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is close by asu so that's a plus too. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really enjoyed their food and service.  It was late and we did takeout on a Monday night.  Surprising how many Thai restraunts are not open on Monday night.   The Red and Green Curries were delicious as was the Spicy noodles and Phad Thai.  Egg plant with chicken and basil beef also wonderful.  I was also surprised that there were not more people eating inside.  It's clean and the service was excellent.  I asked for peanut sauce and some extra hot spices to go  They mixed up the peanut sauce fresh at no charge.  Very accommodating.  I really liked the young couple that helped us.  If you like Thai better support this restaurant. Really enjoyed their food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We just got take out from Bangkok Thai and it was great.  The medium was plenty spicy, and we definitely like heat.  We got the red curry and the cat fish, both were excellent.  We'll certainly put this place into a regular rotation for takeout night.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decided to try this place on a date night with the fiancee. At work we order from Thai House on Shea in Scottsdale which is always good food,. I was in the mood for Thai and live in Peoria so this place was fairly close. \n",
      "The restaurant was empty except for one other table of 4 people, which is great for me because I don't like crowded noisy restaurants.\n",
      "The place was clean. We were greated and seated right away.\n",
      "We ordered Thai tea YUM! \n",
      "We ordered the spicy Shrimp soup for an appetizer. Then we waited. 10 -15 minutes later our soup was brought out. I liked it - but it was chicken not shrimp (that's one of the reasons I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars). Apparently the fiancee wasn't reading when I asked him if he wanted to try that soup, it has mushrooms and he hates mushrooms, but he said he wanted to try it. I thought it had good flavor. Watch out for the hard crunchy things (I think it was pieces of ginger) as they have a bite to them and are bitter.\n",
      "The waitress came to ask how our soup was and immediately appologized for the mistake of chicken instead of shrimp.\n",
      "She even had the cook make a small bowl of the shrimp soup for us.\n",
      "Our entress were brought out about 10 - 15 minutes later. I had the shrimp and pineapple curry. Yum! (not as good as Thai House but a close comparison, I'll ask for it to be a little spicer next time as I asked for mild).\n",
      "The fiancee order the cashew chicken YUM! the sauce was very good, not too salty. Lots of good sized cashews.\n",
      "We ordered fried rice to serve it over.\n",
      "Everything was very delicious.\n",
      "When we were almost finished the waitress came out with a bowl of coconut ice cream with chocolate drizzle. VERY YUM!! She said she was very sorry for the mix up with the soup and wanted us to try the ice cream. She said it is homemade with organic coconut milk.\n",
      "VERY nice gesture. \n",
      "Excellent customer service (other restaurants could learn a thing or two from them)\n",
      "will be back when the Thai craving hits again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place is pretty good! I've been here 4 or 5 times now at both lunch and dinner times. I'm not sure why there's never anyone else in here though. Maybe it's more of a pick up place. The servers are so sweet. Lunch specials are $6.99 and include soup and a fresh roll. Tons of vegetarian options - they do their tofu really well. I recommend the cashew nut with tofu. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm still trying to figure out their spice levels. Once I ordered spice level 5 and couldn't even eat the dish. During lunch they don't even ask your spice level preference and it comes with no spice at all.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ordered take out from here one evening when we didn't feel like cooking. As others have mentioned, don't let the outside stop you from trying this place. It's a generic looking strip mall, but inside this place is quite nice. We ordered online, using EatStreet (I believe), and when we arrived to pick up our order a very friendly woman helped us at the counter and our food was hot and ready to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters we had Chicken Satay and Crab Rangoons. The Crab Rangoons were what I expect, no complaints there. The Chicken Satay was really tasty - cooked properly and well seasoned; served with a nice peanut satay sauce (it's odd how this sauce differs from Thai restaurant to Thai restaurant, and Bangkok Thai's is a pretty good one).\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, my wife ordered The Queen's Fried Rice and I had the Spicy Noodle with chicken. The Queen's fried rice is filled with generous portions of chicken and shrimp and the rice was cooked nicely - soft and of a good consistency. Spicy Noodle is simple but filled with good flavors. Not very spicy in my opinion, but I eat a lot of hot food so I have a bias. I added some chili paste at home and went on happily.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a 4 star experience and we'll certainly be back to try more menu items.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm glad I found this place!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had been looking for a thai place to try after our last adventure in dining thai had ended badly and found Bangkok Thai BBQ revitalized my hope for enjoying thai food.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, their Thai Tea is fantastic. Its probably on the sweeter side for most people but I think its amazing. My girlfriend and I crave them constantly and currently this is the only place we know that serves it so well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In regards to their dishes, amazing as well. I tried both the Pineapple Curry with Pork and Sweet Basil with Pork. The Pineapple curry was something I had never tried and would get again and again from now on however, the pineapple slices themselves were not the sweet focal point but rather the tomatoes which I loved. I don't even like tomatoes!\n",
      "The sweet basil I also had with pork and was also very good. I was worried when I ordered it that the basil flavor might be too strong or overpowered but it came out just right, very balanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'm coming back for my thai tea and those curry puffs they serve as appetizers. They are unreal and you will fight over them when you are down to the last puff.\n"

It's next to a charter school so there might be some kids outside smoking.  I guess it used to be a Mexican restaurant, and you can kind of tell inside from the mirrored arches.  I had the chicken curry lunch special version.  Comes with soup and a spring roll.  The portion of chicken curry was small, but for a lunch special it's not a bad deal- I think around $6.  The food itself was tasty and the service was good.  My water was always refilled.  The \"atmosphere\" of this place leaves a lot to be desired, but maybe if they get some more customers then they could eventually move to a nicer location.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

I found this place through Yelp and here I was thinking it was on Cactus and I drove all up and down and sideways before pulling into a residential area and finding out its on T-Bird.  Needless to say, I was pissed at Yelp and Google maps for providing me with the wrong information and as of today, it is still showing this place on Cactus.\n",

Daughter loved her pieces of magura, yellow tail and salmon , they looked clean and fresh.  We also had the Caterpiller , always a favorite. I can't wait to go back.\n"

I really wish I could remember the names of the things we had. They may come to me before I finish this review (\"Come onnnnnn Red Bull, kick in!). Whenever there's a non-sushi regular, one has to ease them in slowly via the mandatory introductory \"If you're going to actually like anything, it's probably this California Roll\" routine, avoiding squid and things that protrude out at one's face whenever possible. So, the California Roll, like Tennis in that it's easy to get but difficult to master, was actually exquisite! If I remember correctly, the next roll was a Dragon Roll of sorts with eel, cream cheese and some other seafood stuffs locked in there. Again, quite good. The last item was red and and came in an aluminum foil viking ship. It too was quite good. All in all, a nice evening with a good friend, sushi and yes, root beer (for me). I'd go here again for sure.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am not a huge fan of Sushi but there were 5 of us and the other four (including one from Japan) really enjoyed everything.  We ordered several different Sushi rolls.  My favorite was the Beef Teriyaki and the Shrimp Tempura.  The others raved about the soft shell crab and the calimari.  Several of the rolls fell apart and since I am not experienced with chop sticks, I asked for a fork.  Almost done eating before the fork came but it was a very busy night and the service was fine otherwise.\n",

      "Had a Hawaii roll, with the best tuna! Very pleasantly surprised by our meal. All of our food was top notch. We always look forward to sushi because we don't get it very often... living in Northwest Iowa. We weren't disappointed with this spur of the moment decision.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

The Crunch Roll wasn't as crunchy as I'd hoped, but I think that's because we refrigerated the rolls for a few hours before eating them. The hostess who helped me was very friendly. The cost came to about $40 with tip, which isn't terrible for the quality of the sushi. I'll definitely be back.\n",

Nice display of major league athletic team stuff including a whole wall of photos of the staff with major league players who have visited the restaurant.  Our waitperson was delightful.  The Spicy Poke Salad was the best I've had since I left San Francisco.  We asked for it with tuna only.  I'd make the trip back just for this.  We managed to polish off a Philly Roll, and Tiger Roll and a Rainbow Roll with very little effort, but we waddled out when we left.  I've never had a Rainbow Roll that was totally wrapped in shrimp!!! FANTASTIC.  I would definitely go back; in fact this might be my new favorite sushi place.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like this place. Scratch that...love this place.\n",
      "Sushi is definitely in my top five favorite foods and Kabuki does it right.\n",
      "\n",
      "This little place is tucked into a small plaza, and is never too busy, however, the service is always really great. A lot of the people who work here went to high school with me, so it is kind of refreshing to see some of their faces!\n",
      "\n",
      "The food is superb. I absolutely love the \"Rock 'N Roll\" and their \"Vegas Roll\" is one to brag about. They have a pretty vast selection of saki and a full bar. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I would not recommend here is their White Russian. Ick. Normally they don't come in such tall glasses, and this one is just overkill. Too much of a good thing is never a good thing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pretty good restaurant. You cannot beat the lunch special here though. Got one and shared it with another person. Alcohol is expensive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Love this place.  Great service.  Very clean.  The Phoenix roll is a must.  They usually have a couple games playing on TV.  My dad has taken his boss here, my grandma had her first sushi here...  in fact, I think I want to go tonight.  Yum.  Oh, I also think it is very affordable.  The fancy rolls are $13.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you haven't had the dynamite roll... you must try it. It is amazing!!!! And they have red snapper shashimi here so delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not a big fan of the vegas roll this particular place serves.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Phoenix Roll... So yummy! I have to say this place has great tasting rolls and it keeps me coming back for more! I've tried other places, but for some crazy reason I keep coming back! Call it addiction, or just  great tasting sushi! Service is great!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have tried many of their rolls and if this review was strictly based on the sushi I would give it a 3.5.  The sushi is exactly that.  It is just slightly above average.  The other .5 was added due to the service.  I have never received bad service here.  They are always fairly prompt and adequately friendly.  Decent sushi and good service.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "They have a very good selection of Sushi, and other items for you lovers of cooked food. They have a good bar menu and the service is fast and friendly. The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is clean.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I went with 2 friends, and we decided to order a couple of the sushi rolls...we went with the Alaska Roll, the Vegas Roll, the Hawaii Roll, the Lobster Roll and some salmon nagiri.  Everything was amazing!  We had fun mixing and matching.  My only issue was, the Lobster Roll didn't have any mention of a Dynamite Sauce on it in the menu, so I wasn't able to eat it (the reason for not giving 5 stars)...I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy things.  But, my friends enjoyed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Amanda, our server, was a delight to have serving us.  We left feeling like she was an addition to our little friend group.  When we go back (and we will!), I truly hope she's working that day.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "When I want sushi I go here! It's as simple as that. Absolutely love this place, the ambiance is amazing and location couldn't be better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was reluctant to try this place because it only had 3 stars, but was craving for sushi and it's the closest one. Glad I did!! Great waitress, we got seated at the bar but she was very attentive. I love the menu with pictures of all the sushi and appetizers, make ordering so easy. The rolls was delicious and fresh salmon and tuna. Also free Edamame!!! Will definitely come back to try other rolls\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pretty darn good!! Too early to give it 5 stars, but nothing to complain about. Good presentation, appeared relatively clean, no overpowering smells, and friendly looking staff. The staff appeared clean and happy to serve us. Food was not too pricey and was served in a timely fashion. I opted not to try the sushi this day because it's it's very consistent among the better local areas. We had the fire cracker app which was unique and AMAZING!! Definitely a must try if you've never had it! The entrees were awesome too! If the sushi is above par, then I will give it 5 stars.  It all comes down to the presentation and staff because most sushi places are falling behind in one or the other or both. I felt comfortable and important which made the overall experience very positive.\n"

      "This place has a nice lunch special. You get soup, salad and a three selection combination plate for about $13. I chose the teriyaki beef, combination tempura and California rolls. I couldn't finish my plate. The service was good and the atmosphere was fine for lunch.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My wife and I ate their for our weekly date night before going to see a movie.  Kabuki's happy hour is from 3-6pm, and offers a wide range of appetizers, salads, sushi and rolls to satisfy most people.  I'm definitely not a professional sea-food critic, but I've eaten at at least 6 different sushi places in valley.  Kabuki is one of my favorites thus far...especially for the price.  Vegas roll was awesome, and their Shrimp spring roll was very delicate, and tasted fresh.  The edamame appetizer for free was a nice touch as well.  I'd definitely recommend this place without hesitation.  Oh, and a 12oz draft of Sappporo for less than $2?  Pleasant surprise!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I haven't been here in a long time and the food is still as good as I remember the sushi it's not the greatest. it it's good they have all the normal rolls but I like there lunch specials 11 bucks you get soup salad cabbage salad your protein and two sides so much food and it all tasty the service is always grate I'll be back\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The restaurant is located in a strip mall, but not strip mall quality food at all. The Phoenix and Dynamite rolls were both good. The menu tells you what is both inside and outside the roll so easy to choose menu items if you have dietary restrictions.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had a very enjoyable visit recently! Food was very flavorful but I'm kind of a fan of hot food being served hot. Everything was the same temperature. The service was EXCELLENT which is what really bumped up this rating. \n",
      "\n",
      "We tried a variety of dishes from teriyaki chicken, cactus rolls, the shrimp california roll, and the Arizona tiger roll. We also had gyoza, and the combination tempura. \n",

      "All in all, this is a great little place and I am really looking forward to going back soon! Just hope they watch their serving temps.\n",

      "\n",
      "also, my friend told me that these guys aced their health food inspection which i know is important to some of you yelpers.\n",
      "\n",
      "minus one star only because they close at 10. with good food and lots of beer i usually want to stay out later. so go here, but don't go too late, or you will accidentally waste your spicy tuna too.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "First I am not a sushi expert. I do know when I like something. I have been trying places close to where I live. There are many places close to me in Peoria. Until you start looking you don't realize just how many places there are. This is one place I had not been. So far this is the best place I have tried. Remember this was just the first visit so until I get in several visits and try more of the menu will I really know how much I like them. The star rating could go up or down. The service was great. The meal was about $2.00 more than I have been paying for something similar. It was better tasting. Fresh distinct tastes. I am looking forward to a repeat visit.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great experience. This is a neighborhood \"joint\" that serves good sushi. Loved the crunch roll. Tempura could have been a little bit lighter in texture, but it still quite good. I also recommend the sake bombs, if you don't need to drive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Great food. Love the PHO and many awesome appetizers. Also serve alcohol. The only problem is the wait staff is very slow. The are friendly so I try not to get to upset. Overall it's a good place for some tasty food that won't break the bank. We Go back often.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The only complaint I have about this place is the slow service, other wise I haven't had a dish I haven't loved. We were very satisfied with our appetizers and our meals!\n",

      "Nice pho broth! Yummy vermicelli!\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our first time here. I had the Pho and my son kept stealing bites. We all shared the shrimp, egg roll and spring rolls. The spring rolls were the favorite. The tea was excellent with boba. Vermicelli with chicken and shrimp was awesome. That's what my husband had. We'd get that again. Fresh, yummy and great service. We will be back!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is our staple Americanized Pho joint! It's close to our house and the food is always good. I can't say the same about their service but consistency is a good thing right?! Whether it's take out or dine in, this place is great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a regular for our family. They have a clean, pleasant restaurant and friendly staff; not to mention really good Vietnamese food. I've had their Pho soup, grilled rice plates, and vermicelli, all excellent. We usually finish our meal with a Boba Smoothie or Mochi ice Cream, really good!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had the tofu spring rolls which were very good with just a hint of mint and very fresh. The beef and noodle dish was very good,as were the lettuce wraps that I ordered as a meal. There was a lot  of food  each portion. This restaurant is very pretty inside and the soft music playing is a nice touch! We will defiantly be back:)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Let me start by saying that we used to live in a Chicago neighborhood that was predominantly Vietnamese. We had over 15 options for Pho within a half a mile. That said.. I've had some phenomenal pho and am quite particular about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We live very close and we were so excited when this restaurant opened. We've been there several times since the opening and and would highly recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the Pho is slightly better and more flavorful at Chandler Pho. However, the  atmosphere here far surpasses Chandler Pho and the service is wonderful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vermicelli is absolutely amazing. Though I recommend eating in the restaurant. We've ordered \"to go\" and it doesn't compare.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sunday afternoon is a great time to eat at this restaurant.  Service was slow and the young waiter cold, but the food is excellent.  Great atmosphere and a relaxing place to enjoy a meal.  I am going to try and visit during the week.  Maybe the wait person will have more personality.   No matter, the food is the real deal.  Oh by the way they have a full bar.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Delicious!!! I had the Pho beef and my sister tried the pork with rice. We were both very pleased and will be back soon! They've done a really nice job and it has a great atmosphere. I'm thrilled to have a Vietnamese restaurant in the neighborhood.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Excellent Vietnamese restaurant.  They are doing it right.  Service is also top notch.  I typically order the V6 which is vermicelli noodles with shrimp and egg roll plus your choice of pork, beef, or chicken.  I typically can't decide so I get beef and pork.  I had the calamari app this go around and was not a fan.  The platter app is good, 2 spring rolls, 2 egg rolls, and 2 coconut shrimps.  Great value and tons of good flavor.  Definitely a spot I will go back to.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is my second time there in 2 weeks. Great steak pho, shrimp spring rolls and grilled beef w egg rolls on vermicelli. Great atmosphere at an excellent price! Where else can you get 2 entrees, appetizers and beverages for $25.  Food is fresh and tasty.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My favorite place to go for Pho.  Wonderful staff with great service!  Fresh vegetables  and affordable appetizers.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Awesome, tasty Banh mi sandwiches, real deal Pho soups in a well decorated dining area. This is the prettiest pho place I have ever eaten where the taste of good food matches the decor! So worth it if you want wonderful Vietnamese food!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Looks like a new place - we had difficulty find it. Thanks to map quest we found it. Once inside u can really see the earthly balance in all the decor.. I got to say live the bar and variety of beers. Their egg rolls and pho delicious. Will definitely recommend and will definitely go back whenever i am close the community....\n"

      "Great little spot I found in Chandler, that serves very delicious pho of many sorts. This place is located about a mile south of the 202 on Gilbert Rd. I really like the setting and atmosphere they are going for here. Very quiet and peacful place to just get away and relax. I ordered the combination pho without the tendon. It was really good! I loved the textures of the different meats, and the broth was very very good! I was very please with the pho here. I will definietly be back to get it again. I noticed they had a few verieties of vietmenese coffees here. I think I am going to try one next time I visit.\n",

      "\n",
      "The only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 is they tend to be on the slower side considering their volume is less then other Vietnamese places we frequent. So... we just make sure we aren't in a hurry when we decide to go there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here on my lunch break with a co-worker after discovering our main Pho place is closed on Tuesdays. We were very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. Very clean, classy and modern making it a comfortable place to dine. The Pho is great! The service very friendly. I will definitely be back!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After traveling to Vietnam I'd say this is the best and most authentic Vietnamese food I've found in the east valley. Very fresh, extremely reasonable in price, and large portions. Clearly family run.  On this busy night every family member was hustling to give great service.  Very pretty and upscale on the inside with a full bar.  Worth the drive from NE Mesa.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My boyfriend and I love stopping by this restaurant every time before I head out of state or just for dinner! our favorite is the N4. Bun bo hue. the broth is really something; fish sauce, crispy fried onion that adds to the aroma, taste and flavor. not to mention, lemongrass taste, and don't forget to add the vegetables, it helps give that crunch. other then that, service is on the slow side during week days, as oppose to weekend night's.\n",

      "Great Pho and Banh mi. Very clean and the service was excellent. Prices are very reasonable. We enjoyed our lunch.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stopped by for a quick lunch by myself.  The place is hidden in the back of a strip shopping center along Gilbert Road.  Once you get inside it is quite pleasant with regular and bar style high tables which I like.  I had Spring Rolls and Chicken Pho, and both were very good.The Spring Rolls were ample size and the Pho filled me up as usual.  Would stop back again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tried this place when they first opened and their pho was just okay. But went back for the first time in a long while, and the soup has improved a lot. Pricing is high compared to other Vietnamese places ($80 for four people?)but everything tasted good. Service was decent.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a fantastic place to grab a quick AND FILLING meal! Stopped by AZ Pho & Grill on my way home from work because I was really craving a Bahn Mi, and they did not disappoint! Because I had never been here (nor had I tried any Vietnamese restaurants since moving to AZ In march) I wanted to try their Pho as well. So I ordered the BBQ Pork Bahn Mi and the Brisket Pho (regular size) both to go. The service was really fast, I got my food piping hot within 10 minutes of ordering, and was out the door! I drove hope as quick as I could (carefully as not to spill the broth) and was pleasantly surprised that the Pho broth was still SUPER hot when I went to pour it into my bowl. \n",
      "\n",
      "The BBQ Pork Bahn Mi was a really tasty sandwich and something I could see myself ordering frequently. The bread was a little less crusty than I'm used to, but it was nice not to have it cut the roof of my mouth as I have with Bahn Mi sandwiches in the past. There was a really good amount of tender and flavorful pork on the sandwich and bonus points for NO weird chewy bits or extra fatty parts. My ONLY complaint with the sandwich is that the pickled veg on top was not sour enough, it was almost more like a sweet pickle, which combined with the sweet sauce they put under the pork (delicious by the way) was ALMOST too much sweetness. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Pho itself was really really flavorful. My wife said delightedly that \"it tastes like Christmas\" which was a complement especially since it was her first time ever trying Pho. The Brisket was really tender and full of intense Beef flavor, however next time I'd be interested to try something a little less intense in meaty flavor as I think it covered up some of the delicate flavor in the broth. \n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely loved that they send you home with all the accompaniments in separate containers so that you're able to add things based on your preferences. I ran out of cilantro and onion, but that's just because I like a bunch in my pho. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this is definitely going to make the rounds into our regularly visited restaurants, and I know I'm going to be back soon to fulfill another craving!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We like this place.  Family owned and operated.  Very attentive service.  Back at you dear over and over again.   Spring rolls and Pho, yummy!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Alright Pho, nothing that stands out.  Service is fine and the place is really clean.  The spring rolls are good and the kids always want an order of egg rolls.  They tried the calamari one time but they were not impressed.  Had the grilled meat and rice plate once.  I always love the Vietnamese grilled meats with the fish sauce.  I just wish the egg was fried with runny yolk.  Other Vietnamese restaurants have the runny yolk so I am spoiled.  When I am lazy and in the mood for Pho, we go here cause it is right down the street.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I usually end up at this restaurant when I am the mood for Vietnamese because it is my neighborhood joint. That said, I solidly believe this is one of best places to get pho and spring rolls. The broth and portion sizes of the beef soup are superior to restaurants in south Chandler.\n",
      "\n",
      "This restaurant is also 10x cleaner and more comfortable than a typical Vietnamese restaurant.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was very spot on.  Had the Pho Dac Biet and broth was very good. The rest of the dishes my family had wets very tasty as well.   They do not do refills and water was brought late to the end of the meal.\n",

      "Delicious food without the long wait! Meals are ready to go within 15 minutes. Ample customization options are available to meet everyone's preferences and dietary needs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the vermicelli dishes - grilled shrimp is the perfect addition. The side salad that comes with the vermicelli is great--super fresh and crispy vegetables, with decent variety. My husband enjoys the fried rice dishes with tofu and chicken. \n",

      "Fresh ingredients, quick and friendly service, great location, what more can I ask for?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "First time in and we will be back.  Very nice space with attentive service.  Highly recommend the grilled beef rolls as a starter - delish and good portion.  I had the veggie Pho and added shrimp -  balanced light and fresh flavor.  Husband played it safe with beef fried rice (added and egg).  After the starter we brought food home for left overs.  Spied the bahn mi sandwiches and look forward to trying those on next visit.\n"

      "Stopped in last night to check the place out because I wanted some Pho.  Everything was great and definitely will be back. The Pho was awesome and service was good.  Best Vietnamese place on the East side.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Very good egg rolls as stated! However, I ordered the V6. Vermicelli with Grilled Shrimp\\/egg roll. (It only has 3 slightly over cooked small grilled shrimp. It was still good food, but next time I will try a chicken dish.  I had also had very good service!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good Pho and one of the only ones in Gilbert. It's clean and the service is better than what you find at most Pho restaurants. It's a favorite of my kids.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here on a rainy night, had the pho bo. The atmosphere was very nice and the pho was delicious. I have never had a pho with broth that I haven't had to add siracha, chili paste etc. The broth had a strong cinnamon taste and at first it was odd but once I added lime I found that the broth was perfectly balanced and satisfied all of my cravings.  Our service was a little spotty (they were very busy and didn't seem to be properly staffed)  otherwise this place easily deserves five stars. I can't wait to go back!\n",

      "Visiting Arizona for the first time. This place was hot and new so thought we'd checked it out. Overall very impressed. The place is super clean! The declarations are tasteful. I know most Viet places can be over the top but this place is spot on. Photographs very well chosen. Having been to Vietnam it brought back some fond memories. We came for lunch. Started with spring rolls which were fresh and delicious. The peanut sauce was phenomenal. Had vermicelli with grilled pork and \"noodle soup\" (hu tieu). Grilled pork was nice but the red pork in my hu tieu was dried. There aren't many options but the ones they have are good. The prices are a little high for Viet foods but I also come from a city where there are lots of Vietnamese places so I suppose when you're one in a few you can charge as much as you want. Our server was pleasant. I didn't catch her name but appreciate that the service gestures are there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "An eclectic, modern atmosphere and fresh, delicious ingredients make this pho experience definitely worth coming back again and again. I had the chicken pho with steamed vegetables added. It was amazing! Large portion sizes means you'll satisfy even the most ferocious appetite, or take it home as the leftovers are just as yummy. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for appetizers, the shrimp rolls were fresh and delicious, and I highly recommend trying one of their shakes. Both the taro and mango shakes were very tasty. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff were all extremely friendly, and the service was fast. The aforementioned atmosphere and decor make this restaurant ideal for an intimate date or lunch with the family.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Visiting from Syracuse, NY and have wanted to try this place near my parents' home. Got take-out combination bun (noodle dish with egg roll, shrimp and pork), my go-to Vietnamese dish. Their pork was dry and I didn't end up eating much of it. The rest of the dish was great! I love the fresh veggies - cucumbers, bean sprouts, lettuce, mint. My brother (tofu noodle dish) and mom (shrimp and egg roll noodle dish) also liked theirs. Thai iced tea was yummy and finished quickly! I'd come back!\n",

      "I have gotten Pho from here 5 times, in the last 2 weeks, :) \n",
      "The first 4 times were great, I called, placed order, picked up, Pho was super good.\n",
      "Tonight I called 5 times & no one picked up.  So I went in and placed the order.  Which is fine, but annoying.  I waited 20 minutes for it to be made, the restaurant didn't look busy but theres \"Door Dash\" and \"Uber Eats\" now, so who knows, maybe they were busy with to-go\\/delivery orders.  \n",
      "While I was sitting waiting someone came in who used \"door dash\" and he said this was the last time they were getting food there because this was mistake #5. \n",
      "So service is obviously an issue here, but their food is GREAT.  The chicken Pho is so good.  I always get double chicken and it's really good, just bring your expectations down in the service department.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was my first time trying Pho so I really have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was great. I had the flank steak and my wife had the spicy seafood. I liked hers more, but mine was still good. This is a great place for first timers. Service was fast and friendly.  Restaurant was clean and modern. Manager checked in on us to see how everything was. You can tell that it is a well run restaurant and they take pride in what they do. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their menu.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Really, really good Bahn Mi. Vermicelli bowls are excellent and filling as well. Service has been good, with the food coming out pretty quick at lunch time. Only downside to me is they don't take Amex.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good food the service is good but could be worked on a little the egg rolls are delicious I ordered the chicken pho tender  meat definitely coming back :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good location. Nice decor. Friendly service and even though their menu says no substitutes, they allowed them. . The portions are large so you'll have left overs. I would go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was my first time here. So disclaimer first, pho is my single favorite stand alone dish. So my expectations are always pretty high when trying a new place. AZ Pho Grill did not disappoint! The base for a good pho is the broth, and their eye of round steak pho broth was probably one of the best broths I've ever had. And I've had A LOT of pho.  The balance ingredients in the bowl was pretty much perfect; not too much, not too little. But man oh man, that broth was good. I would have given five stars, but I can't because all I ate was the pho with a Thai tea. However, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!\n"

      "My god, this place is awesome.  As a grocery store, it's clean, has all your Korean needs and quite often there are samples being given out.  It's big, prices for the most part are fair and all prepared food reduces in price after 7:30pm (hot food, sushi, kimbap) yum.  The best part of this place is that it has a cafeteria that will make various Korean dishes for not nearly what they would charge you at a nice Korean restaurant and yet the dishes taste just as good or in some cases, even better.  The pork bone soup for example, this place has given me the tastiest one I have ever had so far and I've had quite a few now.  The make-your-own lunch isn't bad either except you have to be smart about what you want.  For example, me being not so smart I grabbed some macaroni salad, why that?  I have no idea.  This was a crappy macaroni salad and it was heavy so it just added weight to my dish and made it more expensive.... lame.  Luckily it was after 7:30pm so 50% off!!!!!  \n",
      "When buying food from the cafeteria, I highly suggest some of the combos.  One I've gotten before was $12 and I got a single serving of jajangmyun (which is gigantic and overfilled 2 of us) as well as some sweet and sour pork (deep fried and I would say more sweet than sour).  This meal alone will more than fill 2 of you and I've got to say, the jajangmyun is incredible.  My only regret is I wore a white shirt and sauce got on it.... it won't come off :(  The naengmyeon isn't bad either but you might as well just buy the packages and make it yourself..... other than the egg and cucumber and one slice of pork you get with it I'm convinced they are just using the package.  That being said, it's delicious especially on a hot day.\n",
      "Cheap Asian food is a weakness of mine and this place is making me fat.  Is it worth it though?  Absolutely.  Give it a try and if you can wait till after 7:30pm, I would say do it and eat like crazy!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like the fresh seafood better than the young location. Then have uni in the tray when it is in season.  As fresh or fresher than Dianna seafood.  Also the KOREAN  fried chicken is good.  Not as good as the fry (on tinge) but you can order in advance since it takes 30 minutes to prepare .\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "What's not to like when you go shopping and you find something for FREE?  Yes, as I was perusing the meat section of this uber clean and nicely organized Korean food store, they had neatly wrapped packages of free  bones.  Bones are trendy and so, more expensive now and greatly appreciated by my dog Sailor (the one with the very large, sharp pointy white teeth.)  I picked up some cool snacks and some great take-out food.  I'll be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Funniest thing happened while lining up at the Cashiers.  I lined up at a random queue while I noticed the next Cashier had a line of all Guys.  Apparently that line went faster so I went there instead and noticed what most of those Guys probably noticed as well.  You've guessed it, a pretty Korean Cashier Girl.  Yup, definitely had a GOOD \"check-out\" experience here unlike Michelle G.   ;D\n",

      "My praise on the former Thornhill Galleria location currently does not exist anymore at their new Thornhill Galleria location less than a minute drive away from old spot.  My props go to this York Mills Galleria location which is tucked inside a small road rather than being right on York Mills road.  This means it has become my NEW official Hang-out spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the Case of Oysters as well as Oysters on the Half Shell and individual Oysters available here where as Thornhill didn't have any when I wanted to make Gul Jeon(Oyster Pancake).  The whole setup of the store was similar to the old Thornhill location except the Food Court has been replace by their own Food Island that offers such items as Sushi, Udon, Bibimbap, Black Bean Noodle, Korean Pancakes, Korean Spicy Fried Chicken, etc...\n",
      "\n",
      "Spicy Seafood Noodle($6.95) blew my mind.  I saw a lady got it so I decided to do the same.  It was a complete Fiery Torture Treatment that I regret getting one of the smallest Drinks(Corn Silk Drink $1.49) available.  The Udon Noodle had a Vegetable Mix along with Seafood Mix(Squid, Shrimp, Tiny Scallop, Tiny Mussels).  A-OK\n",
      "\n",
      "The cool thing was that upon your order at the Cashier, she will give you a BEEPER so you don't have to stand there waiting.  The uncool thing is the Drink Fridge behind the Cashier is low on selection so you have to go ALL the way to the other corner of the store to get a better choice of Drinks.  PAIN!\n",

      "The excellent beautifully presented Meats & Seafoods at their original spot is available here too.  The Bakery Gateaux seemed half empty this night.  There is a Tofu booth, Fish Cake booth as well as the Kimchi display.  Btw, KIMCHI FAIR(Jan 21 - Feb 3).  My Friends that wanted ABALONE Congee($4.49) for Breakfast, I can get it for you here so stop complaining.\n",

      "For those that can't WIPE their own ass.  The Multi-function Toilet Seat Electric Bidet($649.00) is for you but just note it doesn't come with the Toilet itself.  Guys, it has as many buttons as a TV remote and even more instructions that come along with.  Enjoy!\n",

      "I enjoyed the custard korean japanese crispy waffle but did not like the green bean one. On monday, they have $4.99 for one lb of their lunch buffet, I got an arrangement of things like seaweed salad, potato salad, sweet & sour pork, sweet & sour chicken, and the Japchae. I enjoyed the potato salad and japchae most. My boyfriend got the pork bone soup. It was fall off the bone good. It was delicious! I also ordered the 6 piece sashimi for only $6.48 and the tuna kimbob. I recommend it all!! \n",

      "I have been a fan of the Galleria Super Market since they opened. The original spot was trend setting IMO for Korean Food focused super market. Alas I moved downtown and my trips have become few and far between to this gem of a  place. Next came their move to a new spot near steele to accommodate surprise surprise a condoplex. The new setup is confusing at best as it was not purpose built (old chapters building).\n",
      "So I had been itching to try out this branch ever since it opened. Finally I madeit  here today and its safe to say I like this spot better than the original flagship just because the layout alone makes a lot more sense. Location is more accessible if you are driving from downtown and there is a lot more to explore in this area as there are plenty of things in the same enclave. \n",
      "In terms of variety I think its about the same as the Thornhill branch. You get your specialized cuts of meat that are geared towards Korean Cuisine. I highly recommend the cuts of Kalbi from here as they sell some of the cuts I have rarely seen in a restaurant (Kalbi King Rib) let alone a grocery store. Then you have your kimchi filled refrigeration area, sauce mixes etc etc.  \n",
      "Plenty of other knick knacks are also there which go well with beer or with mains. \n",
      "There is a food court here as well though I didn't get a chance to explore it much but it looked interesting. \n",
      "A good addition to the ever growing ethnic focused grocery stores.\n"

      "I love Galleria Supermarket.  It's like a Korean Loblaws!  I used to go to the one on Yonge and Steeles, but now that they moved to a different location (still at Yonge and Steeles, but a different physical space), it's not that easy to access from the street, so I like this one on York Mills better!  FYI: the York Mills location is not open 24 hours, it closes at midnight.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, this location has a by-the-weight buffet.  The buffet is awesome.  It's $4.99 a pound, and there is a good selection.  Last time I was there they had bulgogi (I think they always have this), a spicy battered chicken (similar to General Tao chicken, but Korean instead of Chinese), chicken wings, meatballs, noodles, rice, tofu and so much more.  The food was delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is very clean and the lighting very bright.  I like this kind of shopping environment!  When I was there, they had lots of \"sampling stations\" where employees were giving samples of items that were on promotion.  Some of the things they were giving out were dumplings, rice cakes, ramen, and kimchi.  All the employees giving out the samples were wearing face shields and gloves.  Some people may think \"science fiction movie,\" but I think \"good sanitation!\"  I value cleanliness, so this scores big points with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will admit that I come here mainly for the prepared foods and ramen.  They have an excellent selection of both.  They also have lots of ingredients for you to make your own Korean food from scratch, but alas I haven't the foggiest when it comes to that, so I just stick with the ready-to-eat items.      \n",

      "Pros:\n",
      "Ample parking\n",
      "Bigger selection on items than the other Galleria\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Food court not as good as other Galleria\n",
      "Not open 24 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "This review will be more of a comparison to the other Galleria than anything.  Both Galleria's are pretty great, don't get me wrong.  I just like the Yonge and Steeles location a little better for the upcoming reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "First the good things.  I find this Galleria has a lot more selection than the one at Yonge and Steeles.  There were products here that I don't see at that location.  It feels like this location is also larger and able to carry more items.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The parking here is also tremendously better than the other location.  They have a humongous parking lot in the back of the plaza it is located in.  You don't think there would be this many spots looking in from the street.  This is great because this location shares the plaza with a lot of other places so you do need parking to be ample.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the things I don't like as much.  The food court was a little disappointing to me unfortunately.  The other location has 4 different stalls to choose from.  Each stall has different types of cuisine.  This place only has the one stall, albeit a really big one.  The seating is also not as good.  There are bar like seats situated around the stall which is great if you're eating alone.  If you come as a family, you have about 10-15 tables to choose from at that's it. I came for mama's chicken and quite frankly, you can do better for Korean fried chicken.  It's good, but didn't match the hype.  Home of Hot Taste blows it out of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, this location is not open 24 hours.  I have stated the convenience of having a supermarket available at all times during the day.  Most of the Korean supermarkets I find are open 24 hours so it's strange not to see this one as well.  I'm thinking it's about the location more than anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "To finish, you can't go wrong with either Galleria.  I myself just prefer one over the other.  You will have your opinion as well.  We can both agree though that Galleria rocks!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Supermarket: a nicer, cleaner version of all those Asian supermarkets. Kind of like T&T but for Korean products more than anything else. A little pricier than sketchy Asian supermarkets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food court: pork bone soup is super tasty and comes with rice (one of the best). The  noodles in black sauce (can't write the name in English) are disappointing here because the noodles taste like spaghetti and not the traditional noodles. The sweet and sour pork type dish is delicious and fresh and the soft tofu in spicy soup is delicious, but has more of a seafood profile than other ones I've had. \n",

It was so good that we had to come back the next day to try other dishes. Almost everything (see pictures) we had was very tasty considering that it is a food court. My favorite was the pork bone soup, The only let down was the naengmyun, which seemed subpar. We also introduced this place to our uncle, and now he stops by regularly to eat.\n",

      "\n",
      "The cafeteria is a bit hit and miss. Some good menu items like the pork bone soup (flavorful and tender pork), and then some outright terrible ones like the Korean traditional noodles (bland noodles in a bland kimchi broth). Service is generally good, though brusque at times. Solid experience, all in all. \n",

      "Great Korean supermarket that we happened to discover by way of chance. The selection of all Asian type food is outstanding. However the real deal with this place is the restaurant and all the prepared foods. It is out of this world amazing. Selection is huge and food looks and tastes fresh. Everything is available from your Korean fried chicken to noodles, different Korean dishes and also of course sushi\\/sashimi. I did notice some of the grocery items a bit more expensive than other Asian marts I've been to but prices are only a tad higher. If I lived nearby with the busy lifestyle I have I'd frequent Galleria weekly. Asian food is comfort food for me and it's plentiful and delicious looking. Yeah folks come try some out.\n",

      "As a Korean living in the area, I feel my Yelp account would not be complete without a review of Galleria Supermarket. From the moment it was rumored Galleria Supermarket would be coming to my hood, I was counting down the days. I kid you not, I even got \"insider updates\" through friends and family, on how soon it would be opening, and how big it was going to be. Unfortunately I had to work on opening day so I wasn't able to witness history in the making, but I did go the next day, and the next, and the next. In fact, i just came back from Galleria right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "The supermarket itself is very well organized, bright, well maintained and always clean. The service is also very great, lots of friendly ahjumas, ajusshis and Korean college students to help the lost ones. Koreans are generally always in a rush so the service is always quick as well.  The food is very clean and so are the products. Their banchans are good though not as good as some of the ones from the smaller stores down at Bloor & Christie (Korean Town).  Oh and the Bakery is also quite the improvement form the old location in terms of taste and selection. The Sweet Potato Bun, the Peanut Cream Bun, the Custard Bun, all yummy, even the cakes and the rolls taste better. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have AMAZING fried chicken smothered in sweet and spicy sauce, which is worth a try. In fact I'm craving it right now... They also have a really great Lunch and Dinner Buffet, and the prices are extremely reasonable, even if its NOT all you can eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 8 or 9PM, many of their baked goods, and other ready-to-eat food items go on sale for 15-50% off... which is super awesome because\n",
      "\n",
      "A) It's cheap...!!! Buy moreee!! \n",
      "B) It assures me that they only sell fresh items :)\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside:\n",
      "Considering the big location, they don't have as much selection as one might expect. I know, it sounds crazy, but unless you're a pro Korean grocery shopper, that goes in knowing exactly what you're looking for, you wouldn't notice. That said, when it comes to Korean tea, drinks and snacks, I know my stuff. The relatively tiny Hmart down in the North York Area carries more variety when it comes to snacks, probably due to the large population of Korean exchange students in the area.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "- wait time is 30 mins\n",
      "- you can call the general store number to order in advance of your arrival\n",
      "- there are 3 flavors, fried (dry), spicy (fried and saucy) or half and half ($23 includes a few cans of coke and a small side of pickled carrot))\n",
      "- go to the cash closes to the prepared food bar to pay (utensils are supplied here to)\n",
      "- take your receipt to the end of the cafeteria kitchen at the back of the store. You will see custom moms chicken paper shopping bags. \n",
      "- your order should be waiting there \n",
      "- present your receipt to one of the staff in the kitchen area for pick up\n",
      "- if u r enjoying it there and need rice, they have pre packed rice next to the soup at the food bar ($1.18)\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy! It's good. Similar to the fried chicken at momofuko at a fraction of the price!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has pretty much whatever you are looking for - need some Korean beauty stuff?  Check.  Fruits\\/veggies? Check.  Want to pick up a cake for a celebration? Check.  Hot\\/cold food? Check.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a fairly large hot\\/cold food station in here.  The 'cafeteria' has several options that you pay by weight ($5.99\\/lb).  There's shrimp, glass noodles, spicy fish, veggies, kimchee, different meat options...you get the food picture.  And it's pretty decent food!\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a large counter you can sit and eat at, plus they have tables at the side if you want to dine in.  You can also order a hot meal from the menu - soups\\/noodle dishes\\/rice dishes etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the counter they keep their cold food (perfect for lunches at work) Dumplings, meals to go kinda deals.  The prices are pretty reasonable as well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to find a particular Asian ingredient check here first - pretty good variety and the prices are right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tons of parking (check at the back as well) is another bonus.  Don't forget to hit the \"How did we do on service today\" button on the way out!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "You can also get fairly decent Korean food by the pound at the \"cafeteria\" like buffet at Galleria Supermarket.  For $7 including taxes, you'll stuff yourself silly.  Pretty decent selection too.  The glass noodles and beef are a usual standard here.  There's also regular offering of sweet sour pork \\/ chicken.  Love the veg offerings as its the potpourri of side dishes you'd get when you order BiBimBap at a restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have a hot food selection and you can get fresh hand made dumplings, or korean noodles\\/pork bone soup.  They've recently expanded their menu.   \n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly they make fresh Korean Fish Cakes.  These little bad boys have NOTHING to do with fish other than being shaped into one.  It's like a crispy waffle with red bean paste on the inside and it's a dessert.  Mind you.. it's Asian dessert so don't go expecting chocolate or something, but they're one of my new favourite things.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on the way out you can pick up some Hodo Kwajas (aka Walnut Cake aka Korean TimBits).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food here is fresh, delicious and cheap. Even for someone as picky and indecisive as me, I always had no problem of finding something new to try. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's a bakery on the side in case you crave something sweet and small which is perfect for a light breakfast or afternoon tea!\n",
      "\n",
      "The buffet station has all your Korean staple side + main dishes. You can easily create a perfect meal by adding a side of miso soup, (multigrain, brown or white) rice, or hot drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's also the option of ordering your ready to be made Korean or Chinese-Korean dishes like bibimbap, soon tofu, noodle in black bean sauce at the cash register. They give u this device that vibrates and flashes whenever your order is ready. \n",
      "Did I tell u they also have fresh sashimi and sushi to go?  So far I've tried the bone marrow soup, soon tofu, sashimi salad and create my own lunch box - everything tasted delicious! The best part? Averaging only about 7 dollars each meal! \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget to stop by the waffle station to pick up the some amazing Japanese Korean waffle fish! They were crunchy and piping hot - I haven't been able to leave without picking at least a box of 4 each time. I will definitely be back for my Korean fix on our annual Toronto visit.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mom's Fried Chicken - among the very best in T.O. Regardless of if you prefer it spicy Korean style or just crunchy double-fried, this bird annihilates the Colonel and beats Popeyes and Rally's too. Right up there with Stockyards for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love it's simplicity, with a tiny bit of heat in it's plain iteration, and spicy sloppy deliciousness in the saucy Korean style.  Since I like it both ways, I order mine \"Half & Half\" which is exactly as it sounds. I also really like the smaller pieces, with a whole chicken being about a dozen individual pieces, since that raises the crunchy batter-to-chicken ration, which is all good by me!\n",
      "\n",
      "This place can get busy, and chicken can take 15 - 25 minutes since it is cooked to order, so feel free to call ahead for pickup and then either take it out, or eat-in at one of the tables in house. They also have a hot table selection of decent Korean food which is available for you to build your own container and pay by the pound.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supermarket is also excellent, if s bit on the pricy-side, but with correspondingly upscale quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and the cubes of sweet pickled diced daikon is the most perfect accompanyment to the chicken, cutting through both the fried richness and the sticky sweet sauce, and comes free with your order, as do 3 cans of pop on Friday as part of the Friday Special.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stop standing there and just go! Trust me!\n",

      "I love stopping by Galleria whenever I'm in the area. \n",
      "\n",
      "While some of the groceries are a little more expensive than your average grocery store, I don't come here for groceries. Galleria offers so many options when it comes to prepared foods. From fried chicken, to bulgogi, to gamjatang, to sushi, to buns, you can try something different every time you stop by. There's also a food court that offers a wide variety of Korean food if nothing in the actual supermarket tickles your fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything that I've tried here is really good. The red bean stuffed fish cakes are really good, so make sure you try those when you're there. For $1.25 each, it can't be beat. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also love how the employees (cashiers) are dressed in traditional Korean clothing during the day.\n",

      "FRIED CHICKEN AND ALL THE KOREAN FOOD IN THE WORLD.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came here with my cousin to get some fried chicken and go shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this place is super packed, especially around dinner time. The fried chicken is great, but I wish they'd let you choose between light and dark meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a certain time (7:30 maybe?) all the ready made food becomes half price, which means I got some big tubs of soon tofu for a couple of bucks each. Grab them fast, though. Everyone else knows the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This grocery store has nearly everything you want if you are making Korean food. They also have a pretty good housewares section (too good, says my wallet). It's clean and the prices are quite good. If this place was on my way home from work, I'd likely hit it every single day.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's hard to imagine that food court food could taste very good but at this one supermarket in North York, they certainly defied the odds and presented some of the best foods one could imagine coming out of a food court. Galleria Supermarket is located in the east end of North York and predominately sells and produces some of the most popular Korean products and foods.  I have eaten at the food court numerous times and each time I would order something different.  On a very recent occasion, I went over there for lunch and tried out their Pork Neck Bone Stew with Noodles.  ($7.49)\n",
      "\n",
      "Made freshly on the spot, about five large pieces of pork neck bones with meat on them were mixed with a large piece of potato, glass noodles, vegetables, green onions and what seemed like chili seeds.  All of this was cooked in a hot, spicy broth which I would say had quite the kick to it.  Even though the picture didn't do it a whole lot of justice, there was quite a lot of food in this one bowl.  The combo also came with a bowl of spicy turnips and a bowl of rice.  For the price one paid, one was certainly getting their money's worth. The pork meat was delicious although mind you there was obvious more bone than meat.  On a scale of one to ten, I would put the spicy level at a 6 for this bowl.  It had a pretty good kick to it but I was still able to stomach it pretty good. There were also about two wads of glass noodles on the bottom of the bowl just to give you an idea as to how much food was in this one bowl.  All of it was presented in a very hot ceramic black bowl which kept the food sizzling when it came out of the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a great lunch meal to have.  One bowl of rice and half a bowl of glass noodles really filled one up and when I was done, I left there super satisfied and very happy with my purchase.  If one does not like noodles, they also have a 50-item display where people can pick and choose a mixture of items from that display.  They also have pre-made sushi and there is also a bakery there.  Certainly lots to choose from and all made to taste just like it was from Korea.  If you have not been there before, certainly give it a try.  It sure is quite different than some of the other supermarket food courts in terms of selection and variety.\n"

      "\n",
      "This place is not easy to find especially on a snowy evening.. There are no signage at all on York Mills.. the only reason I turning into this No Exit road because my GPS was telling me that it is on the left... \n",
      "\n",
      "I almost park and went inside Dragon Pearl Buffet... but I was amazed to see this huge parking lot around the corner where Galleria front door is!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Galleria as a Korean supermarket does have good selections of Korean and Japanese groceries and dry good. When walking around, I do have a sense that I am not in Toronto but somewhere in Seoul... since a lot of the Korean products has only Korean wording on the package.. looking at the design and picture of the package did make it a fun shopping experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Love the Fresh Seafood department: half shelled oysters, cherrystone clams, squids, Norway salted Mackerel and even a whole Salmon head! The package sashimi graded raw fish is all nicely packed! (much much better quality than what they have at T&T!) \n",
      "\n",
      "Love the Cafeteria part and cooked food area: Fish cakes, packaged banchens, sushi and self served lunch box (don't load up your lunch box since it is based on weight!) and of course the made to order food. I could not resist to check out what the pretty Cashier (yes she was there and she was really nice but not my type!) and the kick ass Spicy Seafood Soup (yes it is spicy, made my tummy nice and warm spicy!) and the Corn Silk drink is nice and refreshing to balanced out the spiciness! Damn I drank the soup too! \n",
      "\n",
      "The Made to Order Korean Fried Chicken I ordered was not bad. Since they are double fried so extra crispy. But definitely not worth the wait of 30 minute! \n",
      "\n",
      "If you still hungry, there are free sampling of food everywhere! Nothing beats having a free sample of a few walnut cakes (3 of those I ate) as dessert to finish off my Korean adventure!\n",
      "\n",
      "Or will I been in trouble if I park myself on the numerous bench and use their free wifi for hours while eating my packaged Sashimi next time?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decided to check this place out over the weekend.  Surprisingly very good.  I love the convenience of having the food court inside the grocery section.  I also love the system of ordering your food then they give you a pager so that you can continue your grocery shopping while they cook your order.  Very impressed with the cleanliness and efficiency.  I wouldn't say that the food is amazing but compared to any other grocery food court is up there in quality.  I wish they had some chicken and pork cutlet though.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Love having a large Korean grocery store close by. It's not your typical asian grocery store because it's pretty expensive and super nice in here. But if you ever craving any Korean food or need any ingredients, come here. They serve hot fast Korean food and Mama's fried chicken. So good!!! They also have one of the freshest sashimi sold at 20% off if you go after 8pm. I usually come here only for the quick eats because their regular grocery items are pretty pricey. Plenty of parking and the best part is that it opens till 11pm.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Huge Korean grocery selection, ok prices, and a large and bright space. Love it!  Also with free wifi. At the entrance you're greeted with a life-size cutout of PSY promoting Shin Ramyon (didn't make me buy any, but I did end up youtube-ing the ad...on the free wifi). \n",
      "\n",
      "Parking is easy to find on weekend mornings, especially compared to other nearby Asian shops at Sunny or Peanut Plaza. And definitely compared to T&T. Pretty calm shopping experience as far as Asian markets go. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the usual grocery selection (fresh, dried, frozen), there is a bakery, and several prepared food stations. Built in to one of the surrounding walls are little kiosks including a clock shop, cosmetics\\/skincare shop and a travel agency....just in case you need one of those.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite section? The ice cream aisle! ...with those Melona ice cream bars I love so much. Don't get sucked in by the Melona fish-shaped ice waffles, I know they're cute, but get the melon bars instead ok? They're better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is the newer bigger version of Galleria and has a much bigger parking lot than the one on Yonge street.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While this is on the pricier side of Asian grocery stores, this place is much cleaner and very well organized.  In addition, fruits and vegetables look much fresher than T&T. Their Korean side dish section is also huge and you can buy certain dishes at 4 for $9.99 or 3 for 9.99 (these ones are bigger). \n",
      "\n",
      "They also have a big food court\\/dining\\/baked good areas which is kept clean as well and has your few Korean staple foods such as PBS, Soon Tofu and KFC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: Great change of pace from Foody Mart, T&T and a much more enjoyable shopping experience if you're willing to pay a bit of a premium.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Galleria is a regular on my shopping circuit for the simple fact that my fiancee is Korea, I mean straight out of Seoul Korean (not Compton). \n",
      "\n",
      "Everytime we go to Galleria my fiancee buys lots of meats, vegetables and sauces so I am assuming the market carries all of the Korean essentials. We are comparing it to the supermarket in the Koreatown downtown so it seems so big. We don't have experience going to the older one as we are new to Toronto. So on the Fiancee side BIG UPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the picky white guys opinion which probably doesn't count for too much considering this place caters to the Korean pallet. I prefer the Kimchi at the supermarket downtown. I find the kimchi at Galleria to be too hot\\/spicy. Second the supermarket downtown in Christie carries a larger variety of Energy Drinks (also my favorite one from Japan) and Japanese snacks so I like to visit there. I only comment on this as me and my fiancee lived in Tokyo for 7 years so it is nice to be able to pick up a few of our favorite Japanese items while grabbing \"her\" Korean essentials. Yes that's right I said it, I did it, \"her\" Korean essentials. Just wish the Japanese stuff wasn't so overpriced!\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Note - if you are new to Toronto and love Korean food, Galleria is definitely the place to go in the North York area.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went here around 11pm on a Thursday to look for Shiseido conditioner as T&T was closed at Cherry St. I didn't find it here, but I found bone marrow for soup and UNI (sea urchin). Forever I've been trying to catch some at Diana's Seafood (pun intended) with no luck. I am going straight home and boiling rice to eat it with. This place is bulgogi and kalbi meat heaven, but I wish I found some pre-marinated. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and service was very friendly as well!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has the most selection of Korean products! Their produce is a bit expensive.  They're pre-made bentos and sushi are great and especially affordable when they go on sale in the evening!  Sometimes you can catch the guy at the corner making fresh taiyaki red bean cake.  They also have a food court with menu prices similar to sit in restaurants so I rather do that.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I come here pretty often with my mom to eat and buy some groceries. We like to buy the apples, sweet potatoes (huge bag, usually on sale), ginger (fresher than Chinese supermarkets), Korean cold noodles + soup (from frozen aisle), lettuce (for kimchi) and so on. The items are usually really fresh, some can be quite pricey so it depends on what you buy here. They have a lot of things not limited to food such as kitchenware, slippers, hair dye, skincare, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to the food section, there is a a food court area and bakery inside. They sometimes have the pork bone soup as their daily special for a good deal. The pork bone soup here is good. The meat is very tender! Although it tends to be on the saltier end. You order the food and receive an electronic device that beeps when your food is ready and you go pick it up. They also have prepackaged meals like kimbap, sushi, bentos, and such. Or they have self-serve dishes that they charge by weight. There is also a fried chicken area specifically for ordering Korean fried chicken. I usually get the bibimbap, you can choose between the hot stone or regular (basically cold but you get a bowl of warm rice). Hot stone is like a two difference or something. They recently changed up the side dishes so that it is self-serve, you have the kimchi radish and bean sprouts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the bakery, I am a huge fan of cream. They sell different types of cream bread here so yes I am in heaven haha. I am a matcha fan so I like the matcha one, particularly the one with a layer of cake in it. It is a bit more on the pricey end depending on what type you get but it is a nice treat. They also sell cakes and bingsoo which I haven't tried. And lastly near the checkout of galleria, there is an area that sells taiyaki. I've tried it before and it is so good when freshly made ahh. Buttery goodness haha. Oh and they sell walnut cakes here (cake shaped like a walnut with walnut and red bean filling, pretty good).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I love Korean food and the culture so I come back pretty frequently. In general the quality has been quite consistent. I highly recommend coming here. They have like a 10% discount for workers on Wednesdays which is good if you work nearby. They have a such a huge variety of meals to choose from after all. Or of you want a quick cheap meal just get the regular kimbap for $3.99!\n"

The cooked foods include gimbap, fried chicken, kimchi fried rice, steamed and fried pork vegetable dumplings, mungbean pancakes, Korean soups - the list continues.

In particular, try out their fresh Sashimi and Sushi prepared foods. If you go after 7 pm, it is marked down 30-40% everyday. You can also go to their food court area and pick up precooked food options such as Bulgogi, Korean Glass Noodles, Kimchi etc. \n",

      "When my buzzer went off I nearly knocked over my chair and ran over to the pickup area. The soup was bubbling and inside sat 4 meaty bones in a clear and fatty broth. It came with a side of 2 banchan and some purple sticky rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meat was delicious and while the broth was hearty as well it wasn't as spicy as I tend to like but this was likely personal preference for me, I think. Overall the dish totally delivered... and may I remind you, this was in a GROCERY Store no less!\n",

      "We decided to try their Asian Food Festival combo for 2 ($11.5\\/person = $23 before tax). This included 1\\/2 an Original Fried Chicken (Mom's Chicken), a Korean Style Noodle with Black Bean Sauce (Jajangmyun), and a Stir Fried Rice and Vegetables (aka vegetable fried rice) with black bean sauce). \n",
      "\n",
      "For a combo for 2, it was a lot of food. My parents I shared it and had leftovers to take home (my dad was headed to play badminton, so he didn't fill up. Had he, this combo for 2 would have been the perfect amount of food for the three of us). The rice and the noodles were both fresh. We sat at the bar surrounding their food prep station and watched them make our dinner! I love doing that. The chicken could have been fresh (they do it to order), but we were in a rush, and asked if we could just get a 1\\/2 chicken order from their grab-and-go station, and they were willing to let us do that. I greatly appreciated that, especially as the cashier had to run around for a bit to make sure that it was okay. Even after we got our food, service was very friendly. We asked for bowls and takeout containers and were given them with a smile even though the meal prep people were very busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We finished dinner just in time to get to their 7:30pm end-of-day sales! I ended up taking home a container of dukbokki (stir fried rice cakes with spicy sauce) for $3.49, a dish of fried zucchini for $2.79, a container of spicy fried tofu for $2.00, a container of soondae (Korean blood sausage) for $3.84, and a container of pork bone soup for $3.84. These are the prices after they had each been marked down between 30% and 50% off! Yeah. I like my discount end-of-day food. Now I won't have to cook lunch tomorrow! Hurray for Galleria!\n",

Bimbap, Korean fried chicken, etc.) and also buy food by pound (like buffet). My favourite here is the \"jajiang mein\" (black bean sauce with noodles). \n",

      "I know the other one located in North York, but I think this one is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered Gamja Tang, kind of spicy Pork bones soup with potatoes. It was good. One of the best I had for a while. And the best part, it was cheap. Made my day.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like Korean supermarket. The products are more fresh and healthy than the ones from mainland China. The  products may be a bit expensive than the ones from Chinese supermarket but still in a reasonable range. \n",
      "\n",
      "The special thing of the supermarket is there's a cafeteria area inside. If you are rushed for you lunch, you can picked up some ready-made dishes for your lunchbox. Some dishes are as good as regular Korean restaurants. Don't forget the steamed rice, it always goes with Korean dishes if you want to try the food in a more Korean manner. This more buffet-like way, I think, it's really a fast way to get your stomach filled nicely. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can also order the food from menu. And it won't make you wait for too long. \n",
      "\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Galleria has everything!   Fresh fruits and vegetables, lots of meats, and a plentiful variety of cooked foods.  You need beauty products?  Check.  How about a kimchi fridge?  Check.  U need a fishing outfit?  They have that too.  It's like one stop shopping.  They have great sampling stations, even a few on weekdays.  Psy is on repeat, playing in the background.\n",

      "This is not the store you can come in and just pick up one thing. Unless I stay focused, I usually am distracted with all the good food. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing for sure, is that the place is clean and neat. All the produce is stocked like someone with OCD had to do it. \n",
      "Although a lot of the Asian produce is being sold here, remember this is a Korean supermarket. Bean sprouts and cabbage is cheap, but other chinese veggies may not be. \n",
      "Apples are quite expensive at least $1.50\\/lb. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're also looking for Asian snacks, you can find Japanese and Korean nibbles here, but chinese ones are hard to find. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was also looking for chicken today, but unless I got an organic whole chicken, it was of no avail. They have lots of beef short ribs (yum hard to resist) either marinated ($23+) or not ($18+), and pork. \n",

You can find so many interesting grocery items here... from their in-house made kimchi and tofu, to kalbi beef, to different kinds of teas (including the 'ballerina tea' to apparently cause weight loss:S), all kinds of dumplings, and fun snacks. It is quite organized, clean, and super air-conditioned (I visited on a hot summer day). In addition to groceries, you can find beauty products like sheet masks and there is even a travel agency! Oh, and they sell Kimchi fridges! Yes, that is a thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "As others have mentioned, order the fried chicken so that you can shop and by the time you are done it will be ready! (They give you a buzzer so you can wander around and it will go off when your chicken is ready). The chicken is really messy to eat because it is covered in a sticky, sweet and spicy sauce. But it is sooo crispy and delicious!! You can buy side dishes to go with it. I'm partial to the kimbap rolls. There is a food court style seating area. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ate here last Thursday morning, and I enjoyed it. I was seated immediately, and after asking what I would like to drink, which was coffee and water, my drinks were promptly delivered. I ordered the Macho Nacho, and it was delicious. I will be back again to try other selections on the menu.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful staff! The food is good too. I love the Hot Juan Burrito, and the pancakes are also great. I have found the French toast a bit dry. The dining area is large and bright. It's very welcoming. I highly recommend The Good Egg.\n",

Anyway, me and my wife like coming here on weekdays, weekends are really busy, this is a very popular place. Love the omelets, and pancakes are very good. Great staff {5-Stars} If you have coffee, they bring you your own pot, nice touch!  Now I am a picky eater, so the one thing I don't care for are the potatoes that come as a side with most breakfast orders. They are mushy, not really crisp, not my style, not seasoned, just plain. One more thing, is the seating. There is no soft seats in this place. All booths are wooden benches. If you have back issues like me, then a long time here on your behind, might cause a bit of pain in ye'ol back. That being said, of course I will be back!!!!! another plus to this place is they have a stamp card, and every meal you purchase, you get a stamp. After 7 stamps you get a free meal, and ion Mondays, you get 2 stamps per meal, this is a great deal!! So i have to give a big Woo Hoo!!!!!\n",

It's OK because I stole bread off my boyfriends' plate and gave him one of my HUGE biscuits\\/gravy,lol.  The meal was still delicious. We got a side of bacon.  The bacon is thick, long, and extra salty.  Think beef jerky.  My boyfriend loved it and I didn't.  I think next time, I will ask for the bacon not to be cooked well done.\n",

I thought the waiter's happiness level was appropriate (I don't need coffee to wake up) and he made sure to check in regularly.  I thought the staff went out of their way to make sure everyone was happily satisfied.  I watched them and they seemed to be quick to make sure turnover kept the wait reasonable.  \n",

My omlette had tons of stuff in inside, the prices were reasonable (you can add bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc to any meal for $1 each). The menu is huge, the company I was with had a chicken salad sandwich, biscuits with gravy, and mushroom caps smothered with cheese. Everyone loved their meal and cleaned their plate. \n",

I always know what to expect, great service, great food and great prices. They have yet to let me down. Can't wait for school to start again, so I can get back to playing hooky and hang out at The Good Egg.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great little breakfast place with lots of options to choose from. If you're going to come in the morning on a weekend you need to either get here really early or much later. Around 9-11 it is packed and their is a wait. \n",
      "\n",

The bacon is also delicious and the orange juice tastes very fresh. After I discovered I had a gluten allergy I was disappointed to find out I was much more limited. Even the appearing innocent bacon and scrambled eggs had gluten (from the egg substitute) so there is not nearly as much to enjoy here if you are gluten intolerant. If you are gluten free and looking for some good breakfast places check some of my other reviews\n",

The establishment is clean, wait times even during their busier times aren't painful (15 minutes or so).  The tables are consistently set and clean.  The bathroom as well, while small in size, is cleanly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu has a variety, but not an overwhelming amount of options.  That is a good thing.  There's something for everyone, don't get me wrong.  Now as far as your options go you can expect your garden variety breakfast items to choose from.  The coffee is good as is.  I'm a fan of them leaving the pitcher of water and coffee pot at the table.  The food is good, not great, but good.  They have a cinnamon roll here that's the size of a dinner plate.  I love cinnamon rolls, but not the biggest fan of theirs.  It has the taste and consistently of a yeasty dinner roll, with some cinnamon and sugar, slathered in icing.  If that's more your style, by all means try it.  It wasn't bad, just not my favorite.  \n",
      "\n",

Now really my only complaint is the three pages of rules that govern their frequent diners card. Every other place I eat at often you get a stamp per entree you purchase, and you can combine cards. The Good Egg is a little more picky, and only gives one stamp per visit, and you cannot combine cards.\n",

I had the catfish sandwich. Catfish being the special at the time. I think they specialise in bottom feeder (cheaper) fish, but do it well! The catfish definitely had some seasoning to it. I also dared to try some of their BBQ sauce on it. And I liked it... The sauce was sweet and spicy.\n",

We only had room for something small, so we decided to share an order of Arctic Char fish tacos. Each of the four tacos was filled with two chunky pieces of fish that was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection, along with some lettuce and red onions. (It was our first time trying Arctic Char, and we both felt it tastes similar to salmon but lighter, less fishy.)\n",

      "\n",
      "The store itself is so tiny, you can barely fit 5-6 customers there at the same time.  It's a mom and pop kind of place afterall.  You order the type of fish you like (the fish selection lies on a bed of ice, and yeah it smells a little fishy), and then you order the other toppings, whether you want bread, or salad, or rice to come with the fish.  They also list their daily special fish on the board.  Price varies from $7 to $12, depends on the type of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've ordered the clam chowder soup, one halibut sandwich, one daily special (grouper) sandwich, and a wild sockeye salmon salad.  We were told to wait about 15-20 mins while the fish was grilled.  The fish was perfectly cooked and was very juicy.  The soup was less creamy and thick than what you normally have in other restaurants, but still it had enough clams. What amazed me was that the bread was so fresh and fluffy!\n",
      "\n",
      "We went there around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, and we still saw streams of customers coming in.  I can imagine how busy this place would become during its rush hour.  You can either wait outside where there is a tiny patio, or you can walk out and come back in 10-15 mins.  Trust me, it's all worth it!\n",

I had randomly found this place while reading blogs and I'm quite surprised there aren't more reviews for this place yet. Nestled in Little Italy a few blocks west of bathurst, this little hole in the wall store doesn't really boast a lot of decor. There is a selection of fresh fish inside, a drinks display, cash register and kitchen. There is a small outdoors patio where a handful of people can sit and enjoy their meal. For approximately $8-$10 you are given only a sandwich. Accompaniments are charged extra. I recommend going with the catch of the day if you don't know which fish to get. Don't worry about how to get it seasoned, the cooks take care of it!\n",

      "I ordered the red snapper sandwich and I was a big fan. Simple sandwiches but the fish was seasoned nicely. It came on a white bun, with red onion, tomato and lettuce. I also really liked the fish because it's grilled not breaded and I think you can taste the fish more when it's not covered in batter. They also put a generous portion of fish on the sandwich so I was glad I didn't order any sides. They have 15 different types of fish everyday so I will definitely go back to try some others. They have plate options too if you don't want a sandwich. Only 2 tables inside so it's better as a take away place. And it's cash only. Every sandwich is between $9-$11 so it's a great deal. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it would have been nice with a spicy mayo sauce or something like that.\n",

      "Salmon with rice and Avacado was amazing. Healthy & Delicious!. I highly recommend this place.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Honestly I've always loved this place, I always get the plate with rice and vegetables. Their house made salad dressing it the best, it's a miso dressing. It's a healthy and filling meal. I've always wanted to try the sandwich but haven't because of their pricing system where it's the same price to get either a plate, or a salad, or a sandwich. The plate is obviously better value, whereas the sandwich seems overpriced at over ten bucks...you can get the 5 dollar special sandwich but it's tiny apparently. Also, their prices in general have gone slightly up and they now charge extra for avocado whereas it used to be just a part of the meal and really brought the value up in my eyes. And...this isn't my personal story but my boyfriend told me the last time he went there he ordered a sandwich and the lady asked if he wanted to add avocado, he said yes, but there was already avocado on the sandwich then she also added an unnecessary half avocado on the side, and the avocado costs like $2.50... That's the price of buying an avocado at most markets... So obviously my issue is with the pricing. The people who own it are really nice, they are a family. I've had a couple different people say that on single occasions they've gone in and the people were kind of rude, but I usually tell people to cram it when they say that because they're allowed to have different moods. They've always been really nice in my experience. I think they have a good thing going, there's no other place like them in Toronto.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

      "This is a small joint that has delicious and fresh seafood. It's a great spot to go to in the summer time. Not so in the winter if you want to sit down. The halibut sandwich was very flavourful and the bun was super soft. Really yummy! I've had the wild salmon and the rainbow trout on rice before and both comes with korean rice and miso sauce that goes amazing with the fish. Though I would like the fish to be grilled and not pan fried. The flavour of the food makes up for it! Go if you are close by!\n",

I mean, it consisted of  burger buns, lettuce, swiss cheese, onion, tomato, and about 6 sizzling, crunchy shrimp which to my knowledge didn't have too much garnish. Still, the combination was oddly very satisfying. I like my food to have a lot of flavour through sauces, herbs and spices, but the dressing wasn't at all necessary. Great little place.\n",

Halibut was cooked perfectly, fish was delicate and seasoned well, my only nitpick would be that it needed some sort of a cream sauce. It tasted like it had a balsamic vinegrette drizzled onto the fish, and it soaked onto the foccaccia bun. Overall I was pleased, from what I remember I almost paid 20 dollars for a drink sandwich and salad so it was rather pricy. It's a very small place with a few tables outside so your best option might be take out.\n"

Ordered 2 sides of avocado but only received but it was too late as we did not check til we got home.  The burrito was good but I had my mind set on a sandwich so I was a little disappointed.  Salad was really good, veggies were all fresh and the salmon cooked perfectly.  The soup was a bit of a let down though.

Fish is marinated with a special blend of spices, which all fold into a soft roll. No extra sauce needed. But we discovered a cinnamon-ade ($3.50 will get you a 16 ounces of refreshing accompaniment to the sandwiches. Once grouper sandwich + white fish burrito + large cinnamon-ade for just under $20 CAD.

The Fish Store has been around for a while and they serve quality fish dishes with fresh ingredients (you can actually see the raw fish on ice). If you are in Little Italy and looking for something fast, yet healthy, this is your best option. Most of the other places around here are shawarma\\/pizza\\/burrito places. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a variety of different kinds of fish including some really fancy ones like black cod. For any fish, they grill it fresh to order and you can have it as a sandwich, salad, burrito, or over rice. They don't overseason it, so you can really taste the flavour of the fish. I had the haddock salad ($9.99) and it came over a huge portion of mixed romaine and baby spinach with lots of veggies. In addition to fish, they have soups and cold drinks. Be sure to check out the daily special too!\n",
      "\n",
      " The staff are really friendly. Not much seating area, especially in the winter once the patio is closed, just 2 small tables. Most people get take-out. On a Friday night after work when I went, it was very busy! Seems like there are lots of regulars. \n",

I never thought I would use the word refreshing when describing a sandwich, but it was the first thought that entered into my head while I was chowing down.

I'd definitely recommend it to friends and family.\n",

So order a soda or another drink..\n",

Next, we tried the chicken tikka masala and vegatable curry. Both dishes were freshly prepared with distinct flavors. We like a little more spice to our food, however and will order our dishes with a little extra heat next time. All together a great place, just bring your patience since their is one man that serves, busses, and answers phones.\n",

Ordered the 'mutton fry with bone' (not the best description) which was excellent- meat falling off of the bones (be careful though, as some of the bones are quite small!) in a very tasty curry sauce; the shrimp masala (such a delicious sauce, with great spice!), the chicken tikka kabob (REALLY good juicy chicken meat and fresh peppers), samosas and paneer naan (both tasty).\n",

      "Everything was good, but not nearly spicy enough. I ordered everything 'spicy', but I think that next time I'll send a message asking for 'extra spicy' (maybe with an added message saying that I'm Mexican and can handle it...). I've got a cold right now that I'm trying to burn out of my sinuses, so I was hoping for some really good heavy spice that would send me into a flop sweat. I can understand them wanting to err on the conservative side, since I'm SURE they've gotten orders sent back by Gilbert whiteys because \"it was just too spicy!!\". But when someone checks the 'spicy' box, they need to get their buttholes ready because the food SHOULD be spicy! Just sayin'.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm pretty impressed with the Chicken Tikka Masala here! I've gotten it multiples times and it's always good. I'm picky about meat, the chicken in it is really good and not fatty or gristly. The samosas are delicious as well. I forced myself to branch out one time and got the chicken curry, it was pretty good but I didn't feel like it had as much flavor as the Tikka Masala. I would like to come try the buffet one day, but so far have only gotten take out. Definitely worth giving this place a try!\n",

      "First time here and the food was delish.  We had tikki masala, chicken curry and palak paneer.  Next time we'll skip the chicken curry and double up on the masala - it was super yum.  I don't care for palak paneer in general - but this had a really nice deep rich spiced flavor.   Garlic Naan was very good - and the rice comes with the food (and extra for $.99 - not the $3-4 for rice some places charge).   They said the veggie korma came with brocolli - which I can't eat - so I didn't get to try one of my favorite things - time to find a new favorite thing!\n",

      "The chicken tikka masala was very good, though a bit yellower and more curry-flavored than I've had -- so somewhat different from the traditional, but we liked it very much. The garlic naan is also delicious. Oddly they tried to get us to order two orders of garlic naan right off the bat, but we declined. One was more than enough for two people. The bowl of rice that comes with the order is pretty small, but it's good. Could definitely have used a second one of those. Ended up being $36 with tax and tip for two dishes and naan, which is a little high, but I'd probably still go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was quite pleased to stumble upon this Indian restaurant.  The place is small and lacks in decor but the service and the food was well worth it.  My only complaint was that he chicken tandoori, although delicious, was a bit too salty.  The samosas were great as well as the garlic naan.  I have recommended this restaurant to my friends.  I will definitely go back\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We went for lunch and maybe that was the problem. The selection wasn't as large as I would have expected. On a plus side it was only $20 plus tax per person which is cheap for a nice hotel like this one. My party was all M Life members with gold status and as we stood in the M Life VIP line and the women at the register helped four other people we were confused. Then the points from the Mlife help desk that we had just left to set up a buy one get one free for lunch didn't transfer so it was a bit of a \"starting off on the wrong foot from jump.\" The waiter was nice and attentive.\n",

      "Only 3 stars because the quality is only ok but.... what more could you ask for. It's a buffet! They haves tons of options. The sushi isn't bad. They have unlimited beer wine and champagne. The prime rib was fabulous. The crab legs were dry and the dessert was lacking in my opinion. I would have killed for a warm brownie. But over all a good choice and yummy. Great when you can't decide what you want.\n",

      "OK so their dinner i thought nothing was really special (the only great part is them having all u can drink champagne and wine) but i came here on another day for their brunch and their brunch was really good! I think for the price tag for their brunch it really nailed the spot! The prime rib and the braised ox tail hit the spot BIG TIME! I believe that both of these items are what makes this buffet worth it. The crab for me was too dry but the meats for the most part were tender and juicy! I think the prime rib and the ox tails were the only highlights to this meal, everything else was just mediocre. Service here was great! If you're going to vegas on a budget and still want a buffet i would say check this place out otherwise go elsewhere.\n",

      "The one thing I don't like is how they have the coffee cups upside down on the table.  The least they could do is put them on coasters so the lip of the glass (where you put your mouth) isn't resting on the table.  You hope the tables are wiped down after each gues, but you KNOW they aren't washed after each guest.  Blah.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sadly their buffet, over my last three visits (one a year) has steadily declined to a level of mediocrity. Their price remains the same! A top notch price with a mediocre buffet.  Their desserts are quite average now and their once outstanding baked or fried chicken is now average. So goes for the other foods I like. I can find better buffets for a lower price than Bayside. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Acceptable buffet. They have a theme setting around the buffet; Asian, Mexican, Southern, Italian. Salad bar was great. Desserts were ok. The meat was pretty good, chicken a bit dry. Still having trouble swallowing the high prices.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Meh. Not too bad, but nothing to write home about, many other buffets are better than this. Still, reasonably priced and a good option for a brunch.\n",

      "I visited during the holiday season, so we paid $32.60 per person for their holiday special, which lasts all day. If you're coming here for interesting food options, then you're better off at other buffet places on the Strip, like Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan. Lastly, if you're dining during the day, ask for seating next to the windows; you can bask in the warm sunlight. That's the beauty of being out in the desert in the winter.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "When in Vegas might as well hit up a buffet and this was the most convenient one to go to and considering the cost for their weekend brunch and the selection and quality of their proteins I was not disappointed.  The ones that I enjoyed and went back for seconds were the marinated steak, prime rib, osso bucco and the oxtail stew. I was in a meat coma afterwards. I also enjoyed their collard greens and steamed veggie mix of squash\\/carrots\\/broccoli - had to make sure I ate my veggies too.\n",
      "I generally don't have a sweet tooth but I decided to indulge of some of their dessert treats since we were on vacation anyway. I tried and enjoyed a bit of their bread pudding, classic cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake, berry cobbler, and apple pie ala mode. Man was I over my daily caloric intake for the day! Hahaha. We also had coffee, hot tea, and pineapple juice (not always available so bonus that they had it). Service was decent although she did forget the juices initially. Would consider coming back here especially if staying here at the resort.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We had dinner here for my first time (and probably my last) at this buffet. Some people are probably easily fooled into thinking that the food here is really good just because the dining room is so picturesque. I mean it was nice, sitting on the patio with a view, but it pretty much ends there. I must have taken one bite of everything on my plate and pushed it aside. The carrot cake was the only thing that I thought was good enough to finish. It's definitely not worth the wait. For around the same price though, I'd rather be at Paris or the Bellagio buffet.\n"

The excitement of having crab legs with my eggs, pancakes and bacon was great, but I really wish I wouldn't have done that.

That's just too bad I say though because my three mimosas would have tasted much better with a do-it myself omelet or a waffle bar.  They were good regardless, but the delicious bacon wrapped pork, or the fried shrimp just didn't do to my belly what i had wanted to happen.  I wanted magic.  I wanted taste explosions.  I wanted my stomach to thank me personally.  But all that happened was a too full belly, $20 i'll never get back, some wasted food on multiple plates, and some nasty gas.\n",

They make omelets, bbq ribs, roast beef, Chinese food, scrambled eggs, bacon, turkey bacon, sausages, rolls, crab legs, fruit,  oatmeal, grits, cerals boxes, desserts, etc. Our waitress was nice with good on refills.  No lines and they offer self online registers.\n",

We also had a B1G1 Free voucher from MyVegas and wanted to use it for our kids. (Well, because they're cheaper). However, under no disclosure, the kids price was not honored to use for the coupon. \n",

The champagne tasted quite good, though I just had 1\\/2 glass and had to drive after breakfast. The pastries like the croissant and some desserts (ie. bread pudding) were excellent as well.  I would say $30 for breakfast is a tad on the high side but unfortunately, we came on a Friday instead of a Thursday morning and that was the only choice available. \n",

They put the exact same food items on both sides of the buffet, so you initially think there's going to be double the options that are actually available. Also, I'm not sure if all buffets do this, but it's annoying giving a tip before you even know what service is going to be like. Maybe that's just me though.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mediocre buffet at best. I stay and play at Mandalay Bay quite frequently and the buffets usually come either complimentary or they come with the stay when I book a reservation. The last stay I completed with Mandalay Bay I received the two buffets and when we arrived there was nobody at the host station. Odd.. especially for a peak busy weekend night. I started at the pizza station where I found most of the pizza burnt with the lack of tomato sauce. Pepperoni pizza that had about 3 and a half pieces of pepperoni lol. The Italian station was just as bad and I think I was only impressed with the meatballs and kept it moving. The carving station usually is my favorite and even that was off. Meat looked so dry and just not even appealing to eat! The service was actually good and our waitress was very attentive with keeping the drinks filled. I believe that if they could only improve on the food quality that would help the foot traffic of this buffet. You have to ask yourself sometimes why are they offering the buffet for free with certain promotions on the room. It's a marketing strategy that obviously helps increase the number of people to visit and eat. But it's going to take more than just an offer to come eat comp'd for me.. I need the food to improve.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Our family went to the buffet on a Sunday around 1:00, there wasn't any wait.  It seems a little over priced at $29 for what you get.  The upside - hot crab legs and prime rib, the prime rib seemed to be hit or miss on the cut, some were OK and some were very fatty. The kids loved the breakfast items and the dessert bar, waffle cones were a big hit.  The down side, the service.  Our waiter came back once to refill drinks then was MIA. At some point another server started taking our plates but we ended up having to stack them on another table.  The kids loved it.  I would have rated it a little higher for $20, but not that great for $29.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "$23 for lunch. Plenty of seating spaced apart. Wednesday around 12:40pm no wait whatsoever. Their sushi selection is lame (four grocery quality rolls) but they had a better Chinese selection (fried rice, show mien, sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, tofu, pot stickers) than MGM Grand. They offered a pasta station where you chose the items and they cook for you (marinara or cream sauce; I chose Marinara and was less than impressed with the taste) Their Italian option is Bleh. Cici pizza looking slices, cheese ravioli and wrapped pasta. The carving station only offered beef or turkey. Shrimp cocktails were on the smaller side and not fresh ice cold. A pretty impressive selection of protein: oxtail, veal, pork chop, ribs, different types of chicken, and fish. As I was staying in the Southside, coming here was easy using the tram from Excaliber. Not sure I would bother venturing here otherwise  unless I was already around here. It's really not that bad of an option, I only came because I had a complimentary pass. It turned out better then expected after yesterday's disappointing MGM Grand Buffet experience.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I do not like buffets at all, but you can't come to Vegas without trying a buffet, right? So on our way back from the Shark Reef, we stopped in to get some food. Paid about $30 at the kiosk, and were immediately seated.  Service was great. Food wasn't bad, and there were plenty of non seafood options to choose from as well. For someone who doesn't typically enjoy buffets, I definitely ate my money's worth. \n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "A little bit better than most buffets in Vegas due to the fact that a) it's never that busy b) they seem to have fresher food than other buffets. It's one of those buffets where sure if you are in the casino and you are hungry then yes you might as well eat there. But don't make any special arrangements to go there - you would be quite upset.\n",

The eggs Benedict was dry up and looked unappetizing. \n",

There was even a section serving Asian entrees such as chow mein, kailan, orange chicken, etc. I felt the crab legs, kailan, and a couple other items were too salty, but the rest were quite good. The dessert was very exquisite; there were several mousses and cakes.\n",

It was extremely annoying to have to wait in a super long line for food at a buffet. I don't even understand why people were lining up, but in fear of being accused of cutting, I joined the flock. But even with the insane amount people (most of them gamers), the service was great. \n",

Had it not been for those credits, we probably wouldn't have bothered going at all. With those credits, we went 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed. For it being the Mandalay Bay, I honestly expected a better buffet. Having read previous reviews though, I knew not to expect too much...and even then, it was still vastly underwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first visit was during the dinner hour and, luckily, we got there before the rush (though, you wouldn't know it because it was still a madhouse). Best part? There was a couple who partook in the unlimited beer\\/wine thing they had, and the lady drunkenly HUGGED the dude behind the counter before exclaiming how drunk she was. Vegas at its finest. Worst part? The service. We probably had 4 plates on our table before our dude finally picked them up, we always had to ask for refills...and I'm not really sure why it's seemingly allowed to have children LAY on the floor in the middle of the walkways while their parents eat at a table. Maybe that's not a MB thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Second visit was during their champagne brunch buffet, and that was at least more worth it for me...if only because I took advantage of the cheap champagne and had several glasses with my cranberry juice. This visit had much better service than the first, which was surprising because it was WAY busier.\n",
      "\n",
      "So again...had it not been for those credits, we wouldn't have bothered with the buffet. Especially if the lines were as long as they were during our stay there. Also? Don't eat the sushi...the one I picked up smelled like it was rotting.\n",

Brunch included champagne and had a wide variety of breakfast\\/lunch items including omlettes, crab legs, sushi, steaks including prime rib, fruit, cheeses, tamales, carnitas, potstickers, spring rolls, lamb chops, smoked salmon and trout, and a wide variety of desserts. Dinner was less impressive with many of the brunch items still on the menu - but no champagne. \n",

      "We did the Sunday brunch buffet and it had lots of offerings. Some items were a little dry or hard (pancakes, French toast sticks, etc). Other items were delicious and I paid the extra to have the endless \"Brut\". The waitress was a little sarcastic when I needed extra orange juice to out with my champagne, so that was annoying, but she did eventually bring it out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Service was great. Patrons around us not so much. To maximize your value, start with the item you really want to eat first. Flank steak, beef short ribs, all excellent. The flatbread pizzas are AMAZING!! Crab legs were mediocre. Word to the wise wait till they bring fresh ones. Don't eat the crab legs that are at the bottom of the Schaffer.\n",

Also this buffet did nearly nothing to try to separate itself from even low end vegas buffets which is a shame considering its one of the top MGM resorts in Vegas.   No crab legs for lunch, no made to order waffles or crepes, not even a gelato station.  They did have a made to order pasta station but I found the options of what could be made there half hearted.\n",

We walked around the casino stopping to look at the menus posted outside of the different restaurants and so many entrees were $20-$30 for just a salad or a sandwich so when we saw that the all you can eat brunch buffet was only $25.99 we were sold! My husband who loves his meat dishes was in meat heaven. He loved loved loved the korean flavored marinated steak. He also enjoyed the prime rib, oso bucco and oxtail. I'm more of a seafood fan and was not as impressed with the selection. My go to dish at any buffet are the crab legs and the crab legs here are by far the scrawniest crab legs I've ever had. They also had shrimp cocktail which tasted fine, mussels, and a small selection of sushi which was more rice than actual fish. I saved a little room for dessert and thoroughly enjoyed their oreo cheesecake and soft serve ice cream in a waffle cone. Overall not a bad deal for the price, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back, but if I was already staying in the Mandalay or Delano, I'd be willing to eat here again.\n",

The breakfast was okay and tasted like any other breakfast place like IHOP or Denny's. However, they do have delicious lox and crepes. The wait for the brunch was not too long and the service was excellent. The waitress for our table was very helpful and attend to our needs frequently. I would like to try their dinner buffet next time.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I dined here last Saturday during lunch and paid about $43 for two people. They have a lot of food choices, although I would rate the taste of all the dishes I tried as a MEH. They did refill the sodas and waters on a consistent basis and the staff was pleasant and professional. I think I enjoyed the desserts the best; Everything I tried was good. My favorite was the coconut and pudding concoction.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Kinda disappointed in the quality of food at breakfast. I'd eaten the dinner buffet in the past and was satisfied. I loved the pasta bar, so I was excited to be up early enough to catch breakfast however, I was let down. The food was hardly seasoned, all rolls or biscuits were like rocks. And the options were few, each side had the same selection. The server Gloria was great but I don't think I'll be eating breakfast here again.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was okay, pretty average. I don't feel that it was worth the money. There is free alcohol but it's only a few select wines and just bud light. There is a decent selection of food, and what was available was good so no complaints.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Way to expensive for what you get. The choices where limited and not real value. Quality was average not more. Family of four was over $120. Not worth it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We came here for breakfast and there was no wait.  However, one table had four people smoking and the server didn't do anything about it.  The service was prompt and the place was clean.  The food was OK for the price.  We'll be back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think 3.5 stars is about right.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came here last Saturday night after narrowing it down to Rio and Mandalay Bay.  Mandalay Bay won out this time because we ate at Rio the last time we were in Vegas.  It's always good to try something new, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "For about $30, you're treated to a better-than-average Vegas buffet.  I think for about $35, you can eat all day long. I'm not really sure if that requires you sitting in the restaurant all day and eating, or whether it means you can leave and come back to eat whenever you want.  Either way, it sounds awesome; I mean, I think the prospect of having a buffet be your day-long prison is a pretty sweet and ridiculous idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, here are some highlights:\n",
      "+ Lots of seafood!  Crab legs! Many salmony salmons! White fishies! Scallops!  Big shrimp!  Yay scavengers of the sea!\n",
      "+ Meats!  Chicken legs! Fried! Veal! Stewed! Prime rib! Other many meats for to eat!  Even though I've been trying to eat less red meat, I was like oh screw it, I'm eating well tonight!\n",
      "+ The Asian foods:  not spectacular, but I still appreciate it being there.  Sushi, pot stickers, Chinese foods, etc.  All decent-tasting!\n",
      "+ Desserts!  Many! All good!  That's saying a lot!  Because I don't have a sweet tooth!\n",
      "+ And one of my FAVORITE parts of the meal: they had CHEESES!  I am a lover of the CHEESES, so when I saw the CHEESES I got all drooly and excited and piled all the CHEESES (they's got blue CHEESES, other hard CHEESES that I can't remember, etc.) on my plate, and that was my dessert.  Loved the addition and the tastes of the CHEESES.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must also note that the dining rooms are very pretty, with dim lighting and a comfortable atmosphere.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So, overall, I enjoyed this buffet a lot, wasn't blown away, but would consider coming back the next time I'm in Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, if you're deciding on ONE buffet to eat in Vegas, you gotta hit up the Rio buffet.  It is KICK ASS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aite, and with that, I'm out.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This place has the crab and the jumbo shrimp but for some reason there seafood has no flavor. I think they probably boiled the crap out of it. Selection was modest and the quality of the other goods were pretty good. The prime rib was so rare it was still mooing which was great, very nicely done. Deserts were disappointing with the selection and quality. The had bread pudding without the white sauce, which really doesn't work. Service is also quite slow so it might take some time to clear the table of seafood rampage.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Came here for breakfast since we had a gift card from staying at this hotel. Nice selection of food although I noticed a lot of the food was cold. The herb crusted salmon was cold which wasn't good at all. The bacon was super greasy. The hash brown was good, but cold. The fruits were yummy and sweet. Some of the meat was too dry. Food was a miss for me but service was great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had their brunch. It was decent. The french toast sticks were good quality.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "While my wife and I only had breakfast and brunch here, we did go twice, so I feel this review is representative of the kind of food and service you should expect.  The hostess service that works the line after payment takes longer than expected to get you to your table considering it is a buffet.  I guess there are still server sections, so maybe this makes sense.  I was glad to see a hot carafe of coffee already on the table as we sat down.  The server will then take your drink order for nearly any other juice or hot beverage.  The first thing I'll mention about the food selection is that the prime rib was surprisingly good, I mean really good.  There was a nice salty, herb crust on the outside which was quite satisfying.  The omelet station was very busy, but the cook was quickly working 5-6 omelets as once, while dealing out Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay anecdotes.  Nice touch and better than staring blankly at him while he cooks.  The cheese blintz were quite good and very addictive.  I'd recommend throwing some strawberry sauce on top.  If you are a carb-ovore, you will be pleased with an entire bakery selection on the opposite side of the dining area.  Overall, a nice breakfast, but nothing that will be memorable outside of this review.  It's relatively inexpensive at $17 for breakfast and $24 for brunch (in terms of Las Vegas anyhow.)  It is also convenient, especially if you are coming from THEhotel or the Mandalay Bay hotel rooms on your way to the convention center.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good but not great. I compare every buffet to\n",
      "The Aria buffet which is a 5 star buffet. Good staple buffet and only $5 for endless mimosas which was great. They served all the staple buffet foods such as  shrimp, crab legs, steak, mashed potatoes, pancakes, fish, chicken. It was enjoyable and we would recommend it\n"

      "Food was good but not the best. Server did a great job with getting drinks and plates out the way. But wouldn't recommend going there.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Another typical breakfast buffet restaurant. Service was excellent, server was very attentive not a large buffet selections but it is a quality not the quantity that count for me. Fruits were sweet and fresh. Ordered omelette just tad overdone than I like but it was tasty.  Would I go back, yes for breakfast.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food was decent, desserts were fabulous.  A lot of things lack labels, especially at the dessert station.  Ate here for lunch, okay selection of foods.  Turkey at the carving station was great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Buffets are not about quality, let's just get that right out there. Buffets are about QUANTITY and getting as much for your dollar as possible. Because of this, I'm generally not a huge fan of buffet style eating. But that aside, the Bayside Buffet isn't half bad when compared against others in Vegas. It has one distinct advantage for sure, FREE ALCOHOL. Yep, they have red and white wine and champagne and it's free. It's not high end but it's as decent as anything you'd be served on a plane. Every other buffet I've been too charged extra for alcohol of any kind. So free alcohol is a Bayside \"plus\". The food was ok, not tremendous but not bad. For seafood lovers they have crab legs, mussels, shrimp, Lox, baked salmon, baked swai (aka..basa) ,  a few different sushi rolls and cioppino (very spicy). The mussels were tender, not rubbery, and the baked fish dishes were both moist, not overcooked and dried out. The shrimp were a good size too. If you're not a fan of seafood, they have pizza (which looked decent), prime rib and chicken . For veggie lovers you'll find things like asparagus and corn on the cob. The dessert section is fairly vast as well with a nice assortment of fresh baked cookies, cobbler, tiramisu, bread pudding, carrot cake, chocolate cake, soft serve frozen yogurt and more. For the $30 entry price you will certainly get your monies worth. So if you're doing Vegas on a budget or simply don't feel satisfied by smaller restaurant portions, the Bayside Buffet just might be your thing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Bayside Buffet on Mandalay Bay Casino really upgraded this buffet. We went a few years ago and it was terrible. We read they had changed it and decided to give it a try, esp since the line was not long. We ate the lunch buffet on a Friday and it was excellent. Granted there was not a 300+ item selection like the fancier buffets, but they had enough good food. Great carved meat selection, italian selection, and other items. Also, had a new dessert bar, not a lot of choices, with personal service and great selection. Very good! Definitely will go back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I hate the word buffet and I really hate the concept of a buffet but sometime I get roped into attending one of the feeding frenzies, but it's never my first choice. I will admit this isn't you're typical buffet but there's still the possibility that you will over eat if you don't show a little restraint. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what exactly does $32.95 get you, for one it gives you a choice to choose wisely or just be plain stupid. I usually like to do a tour before making my selections, the first thing I noticed was that all the serving dishes are small this is an added measure taken to protect the interest of The Bayside Buffet's owners but also protects you from yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always go for the carving stations and this buffet not only had plenty of those options but the quality was pretty good as well. My first plate held my prime rib, sliced turkey and a fried chicken breast and to be honest I loved every bite and could have stopped there but the trays of food were calling my name even though I chose to sit at a table as far away from the mounts of food as possible. My second plate was for the sushi and a few steamed dumplings and a few pieces of cheese. The most satisfying part of attending this buffet was the fact that I was able to avoid the cakes, pies, and cookies and even walked away from the donuts.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good and bad.  The carver took out a new roast because I wanted as close to rare as possible.  Bad is the snow crab legs, dry as dry can be and so little crab for all the work.  Las Vegas Buffet on Flamingo had better crab for 13$.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was a must come in vegas 10 years  ago, classy, wonderful quality of food and wide variety... they stopped improving their menu and now it seems just ordinary, even the Luxor buffet and Excalibur are WAAAAAY better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you're hungry and you're hungry? Eat here. It was late. We were hungry and were, well, in a hurry to eat. Didn't want to wait somewhere to sit and order and wait some more. I'd probably order a salad for the same price anyway thanks to ALL the overpriced Vegas food. This way I got  to eat what I wanted and had my coffee and cake too! \n",
      "I would never plan it this way though. Bellagio buffet is where my heat is.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Okay price with great service. The food selection leaves something to be desired during lunch and the food itself wasn't great. A lot of things were cold and tasted like it was made a few hours ago.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "After visiting the buffet a few times I must say it was pretty good. I realize that in Las Vegas there are many better places for breakfast or brunch. However, the buffet was reasonably priced, a good selection of American Classic foods, Luis it's a buffet so in true American fashion you can eat all you can ;) \n",
      "\n",
      "The selection of food is quite decent, there are the usual so like scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, home fries, coffee, cereals, and so on. So it is a nice American style breakfast. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would certainly be back, as it's such an easy choice to make in the morning it's breakfast and it's a buffet what can go wrong?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "We visited this buffet for dinner last night. The food was good. The server was terrible, we only drink water and we always had an empty cup. Our table of 4 guests had about 10 cups in the center when we left and we stacked our empty plates on an adjacent table.  For the $142 price tag, the overall experience left something to be desired, but I am happy the food was good. The crab legs were excellent.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've only been to \\/ in comparison to buffets at Aria, Cosmo & Bellagio, this was the smallest spread (but still plentiful, with a good variety). I don't recall anything that seemed to be a \"specialty\" to the buffet. However, the food itself was good and priced well. To me it's a buffet off the list, wouldn't plan to go back but if the group was going and \\/ or in the area I wouldn't be upset or mind going back.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for dinner because of crab legs but they were cold. But they have a cook to heat it but, unfortunately the crabs were taken out of the water to soon and all of them except a couple legs were hot. Looks like the waitresses were over worked, but still did a good job.  Other than the crab legs every thing else was good.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I stay at MB fairly frequently, and often end up at their buffet. I'm never disappointed by their carving stations, their mashed potatoes are very creamy, and like that they have (American-style) Chinese food. They steam crab legs too, which is a big plus to my wife. Their desserts are so-so; they used to have a great mini-tirimisu that I could eat a half dozen of, but the last few times I did not see them there. Service is generally good as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'd like to give this place 3 1\\/2 stars but can't do that. Typically I round up, but I'm trying to rate all buffets equally and since I rounded down on the Bacchanal review I rounded down here too! Really, though, for the price this is a decent breakfast buffet. Well especially since it was free with a myVegas reward!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice ambiance, bright and airy. Great coffee, and excellent service. Typical breakfast buffet items, scrambled eggs, omelet station, miscellaneous other items. Nothing standout but nothing bad either. Given you would pay at least $5 for coffee and $5 for a pastry, this place really seems like a bargain.\n",

For the two of us (for a lunch buffet), we paid $23 total. I would definitely come back to this place in a heart beat. The value was phenomenal for the price. But of course for the next time I'd do the same thing, pick out the delicious things (and trust me, there are some- including yummy Lox!) out of the sea of mediocre food.\n",

      "\n",
      "Everything was okay haha, but I rather go elsewhere.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "First I have to say that the service was an A+!  The waiter was very attentive and very friendly.  We got there around 1pm and the food selection was great but the restaurant was not busy so the food turnover was not there.  I noticed that the sushi wasn't the freshest.  The avocado on some of them were browning and the fish just didn't look appealing at all.  I took the last avocado rolls and noticed that they did not refill the item the whole time we were there.  My husband enjoyed the freshly made pasta as he selected the pasta, sauce and fixing in the pasta.  They had a good selection of Asian, Mexican, Italian and American food.  The food quality was not the best but overall it was not the worse.  I just wonder if I had came earlier if the food turnover would have been better.  \n",
      "The dessert selection was above average.  I enjoyed the carrot cake and cheese danish.  Lastly, I did thought the place was very clean and had a great atmosphere.  We sat next to the window and enjoyed the view of their outside.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Its got ur usual Las Vegas buffet flare, as the posts before me has kindly pointed out.  Not my favorite place to go, but great if ur already staying at Mandalay Bay or THE hotel (just because i'm lazy)  If you can get a table by the window.. that would rock!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Overall, a pretty good buffet and experience. There was a very little wait for dinner, and the price was reasonable. The staff, from the hostess to our waiter, was all pretty friendly. The pasta chef was super kind, maintained a good conversation and taught me a little bit about the pasta sauce he was making which I thought was cool! \n",
      "\n",
      "They have many food stations, from seafood to pasta to Asian, so I thought their menu covered a pretty good-sized range. The custom-order pasta station was the probably best part. \n",

      "\n",
      "(1)  Open Bar\n",

We planned on spending a quiet day at the hotel, anyway -- relax at the property's 11-acre beach between breakfast and lunch, and playing some slots and visiting the shark reef aquarium before dinner -- so we did not feel \"trapped\" there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast went well. The house coffee went beyond our expectations, the bacon was nice and crispy, and you could find all the usual breakfast suspects here like scrambled eggs, waffles and lots and lots of smoked salmon. What's more, there was a surprising inclusion of south-of-the-border Mexcian fare served up as well, including some very delicious tamales I just could not stop eating. Maybe the best tamales I've ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch was just fine. Prime rib and crab legs were now available, as were some scrumptious barbecued short ribs. The selection was decent, but not very exciting -- there was no \"wow\" factor. The flavors were good, but not great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choices at this time of day were also infused with many Latin American flavors, including chorizo and beef sausage, a pleasant tomatillo salad, and my favorite tamales. It was, however, a bit disconcerting to see my darling meaty corn husks piled up in the same hotel pan I had left them pining for my gullet several hours ago. Were they the same ones that were put out at breakfast?\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper was a lot less impressive, though maybe it was because we were still full from eating there twice that day already. Unfortunately, there was nothing new or spectacular offered that evening that we did not see at lunch time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure there were a couple of new Asian dishes and a curry or two, and there was some flank steak (that was just a bit tough to bite), but nothing else really worth mentioning. Even the pasta station that was in full swing that night and had a nice selection of sauces, came up short by serving pasta that not quite al dente.\n",
      "\n",
      "After getting our fill at breakfast and lunch, we felt another meal here was overdoing it, so we left feeling stodgy after a couple of bites, and ended up quelling our later-that-night hunger pans with a couple of Belgian beers and a some items off the bar menu at Tender in the nearby Luxor.\n",

I also feel their $16 is a fair price for lunch, but again, I would try to make this a brunch visit, and would not eat both breakfast and lunch here, never mind three full meals.\n",
      "\n",

The meat I got off the carving stations was cold. The fried chicken was good as was the meatballs. My server was attentive and my cup never went empty. If I had paid for this I would have been disappointed but it was worth what I paid, free.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "#1 Pro - best crab legs in a Vegas buffet (as far as I know). They are legit king crab legs.. you know, the huge, meaty ones with the sharp little things poking from the legs. \n",
      "\n",
      "#1 Con - dessert station... I mean, at least at the Bellagio, no matter how full you may think you are, one look and you find the tiniest space in your stomach to force something down. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other that, I love their eggs benedict and french toast. Their mac n cheese tasted like the cheese came from packs, their prime rib is alright, mashed potatoes are not as good as the Bellagio and Wynn. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if I'm comparing it so much to the Bellagio, why did I give it the same number of stars??... Crab legs, people. It's worth it if you are like me, and 95% of your Vegas buffet meal consist of crablegs, 2% is butter, and the last 3% consist of whatever else you feel like fitting into your life.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's your standard buffet fare.  Some good stuff, mostly mediocre stuff.  I went here for lunch and there was zero line on a Friday.  Price was also very fair for a Vegas buffet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I liked about the buffet a lot was the seating area overlooking the pool.  The huge windows windows added a nice feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couple things to note that I enjoyed were the oso buco, meatballs, salt and pepper shrimp, and sesame balls (in the chinese food area).  A couple of the desserts like the cheesecake and fruit cobbler was good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was an OK buffet.  If you're looking for excellent buffet food you would definitely be better off going to Bacchanal or something.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Given this is my third meal here during this stay (and I got one more to go), it warrants a review.\n",
      "\n",
      "If what you have in mind is a grand spread like Bellagio or Wynn, or Ceasars, it's a far cry.  Think more like when a hometown diner puts up a sign for \"all you can eat\" and adds some cheap $7.99 platter of late night Vegas style prime rib and super skinny crab legs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's a very convenient place if you're staying here to grab a quick light bite.  Yes, light, because since thanks to the warning of other yelpers I had appropriately lowered my expectations significantly, and can appreciate that I can get some steamed rice with lightly stir-fried or steamed veggies, and some meats that don't come with sauces, and platters of fresh fruits and berries in the morning.  You need a few light healthy meals while experimenting with all the amazing food options here, this isn't a bad place to make a pit stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention though that's also because we're staying here, and they've included 2 buffets for every night of our stay... else I may have a very different opinion at $29.99 a brunch.  On the bright side... no 2 hour lines either, just walk right in!  The deals on the Mandalay Bay website, highly recommend it if you're staying over the holidays and it'll at least get you a convenient meal for free.  One more meal here to go... I'll post pictures tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing worth mentioning is that the service is really friendly, and people are very nice here.  Will be back... tomorrow!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet was pretty basic. We went for the $25 breakfast and the food was only ok. The real reason to go to this buffet is definitely the $5 bottomless champagne offer that they have! Since we were all a little hungover we just decided to stick with food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was ok. They had almost everything that you can imagine including fruit, bagels, smoked salmon, pancakes, eggs, bacon, omelette station, salad bar, Chinese food, sushi, carved meat, fresh seafood, muffins, cookies, pastries and more! If you are looking to eat a lot of mediocre food without breaking the bank then I would recommend. If you're a foodie, I would skip.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet USED to be a \"must try\" but now is just average. The service is average and quality is average.\n",
      "The per person price is definitely not the highest among other buffets. \n",
      "The wait is also not as long compared to a few years back (I visit LV almost every holiday). \n",
      "I did notice that over the years, they brought in more \"fillers\" like pastas, rice, etc. but what buffet hasn't taken that route?\n",
      "The dessert selection is still pretty good but that might just be my sweet tooth talkin. :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food here was decent, though the selection for a vegas buffet was a bit underwhelming.  For the price though, $40 with tip for dinner, the selection is reasonable.  They had all the Vegas buffet staples, prime rib, shrimp, crab legs, etc.  Everything my group tried was good.  One bonus was that when we went on Valentine's day, they were serving complimentary champagne, wine, and beer.  The alcohol selection, however was not of very high quality.  The beer was bud light and the champagne was nothing to write home about.  For the price though, the return was reasonable.  Definitely worth it if you are not a foodie and are just looking to get your buffet on for under $50.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Good buffet and I don't do buffets. Plenty of variety, the prime rib was perfectly seasoned and the cook working the omelet bar knew what he was doing. In my opinion the only room for improvement would be the desserts, I didn't have anything that wow-ed me.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a decent buffet but lacks the \"wow\" factor when it comes to presentation or varieties of foods offered.  Quality of prime roast was good and like many other Vegas buffets, had a decent selection of Asian dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I ended up coming to bayside buffet as a last-minute decision. We were walking through the Mandalay Bay and we saw they had a good deal on the breakfast buffet with bottomless champagne. We figured why the heck we could give it a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "We walked in the house is very nice and set us quickly. The inside of the buffet was big not as big as some of the other Buffy is that I've been to but we were hungry so we definitely did the trick. We both got the bottomless champagne and I'm extremely sorry that I did because I ended up drinking at 9 AM and I ended up getting sick because I drink too much cheap champagne and I had to go to the room and lay down but that's my own fault. \n",
      "\n",
      "About the food so for breakfast they had all of the necessities that you would need eggs bacon sausage Hash. I found it interesting that even though we went for breakfast they still had lunch items out. You could still get chicken fingers cheeseburgers even had to stay carving station at 9 AM in the morning I was extremely impressed by that. You can get for lobster and crab legs at nine in the morning it was really interesting to see people actually getting crap legs at 9 o'clock in the morning. Their dessert station was fully open they had cheesecakes and pastries in all sorts of crazy desserts. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the taste of the food everything was fine I have no complaints the buffet was just your average run-of-the-mill buffet there was nothing special that set the Bayside buffet apart from some of the other buffet is that I've been to in Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the Bayside buffet was pretty good the bottom of champagne was a nice complement even know that I got sick but that is my own fault this buffet had everything that you would need to experience in a buffet although I would not say that it was the greatest or the most amazing buffet experience in Vegas that I have been to.  If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to a buffet experience I would def recommend coming here if not try one of the other buffets on the strip.\n"

My wife and I arrived here early as possible since we know that there is going to be the dinner rush and they open at 4:30 pm. The surroundings is pleasant just like the hotel, the staff is kind, however the line was quite long because all the kiosk where down. If they had the kiosk operating, the wait wouldn't be that long. \n",

To summarize the rest of the selection is what you expect at a regular buffet.\n",

      "Exterior: inside of Mandalay Bay. Pretty nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service: not the best at all. There was two people working at the cashier and there was two lines that combined as one once you get to the front. So who goes first then? Well, common sense wise, customers should take turns like the family in the left line goes first, then the right side, then the left side. When it was my family's turn though, the family next to us rushed in front of us and the people at our line were annoyed at how the other family did that. When we finally got to the cashier, the woman's attitude was not the best. Won't complain much since it was dinner service and she must have been tired but still...? A little smile or something would have been ok but all we got was an annoyed tone. Water was refilled often so that as good. The friendliest people here were the chefs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: for the price, I would say it's not worth it. Places like wicked spoon or the buffet at wynn charges a high price for lots of food. This place charges a slightly cheaper price but for a less amount of food. Not much variety and the sushi are terrible. The salmon sushi had no crab meat. Only hard rice and a cucumber. The tuna was somehow almost dark purple instead of red. Other food were average. Limited amount of desserts too. I'm a huge dessert fan and I have to say, the desserts were not the best either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel and the chef at the buffet made the experience nice. But the overall food quality and first impression at the cashier line didn't leave the best mark for me.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Why this buffet has been getting great raves baffles me, b\\/c from my own recent dining experience, there was nothing extraordinary about Bayside buffet's smorgasbord; True, crab legs\\/shrimp cocktail\\/lamb\\/sirloin and\\/or filet mignon are served, but so do other better buffet places the likes of Bellagio, Rio, Wynn, and Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paris buffet, in my opinion, still has the most flavorful spread.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Underwhelming compared to other buffets in town. Almost surprising that a hotel as nice as Mandalay would run such a dinky buffet. Go here if you are short on time or really tired. Otherwise, get out of Mandalay and try the Bellagio buffet or Wicked Spoon Buffet at the Cosmopolitan.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hey, when thinking about buffets on the strip, most are about the same. Bayside was literally right in the middle. The selection was, of course, huge. Quality of food was spotty, but they literally had a little of everything. Not a particularly pretty restaurant, but they have unlimited beer\\/wine\\/champagne. At $35\\/person, it's not a bad deal if you're hungry and wanna get your drink on :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been to this buffet over a dozen times over the years, mainly due to having a local family member consider Mandalay Bay their home base.  I feel like I'm always a little bit underwhelmed.  Don't get me wrong, the food is very good, but I just feel that there should be more selection.  I mean, you only have two 'hot' buffet lines, and you have some overlap between the two.  I just think that if I didn't have my familial reasons (along with the partial comp and line pass), I would probably be able to find a better buffet that is priced a little better and has more variety.  Overall three stars, if on food quality only, closer to four.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm very disappointed at the bayside buffet at the Mandela bay.. I'm sure I didn't expected a lot but it's a Friday night (weekend  special menu?)and $ 33.00 values. Sometimes it's so hard to be crossed out my buffet BUCKET list. All buffet menu foods are \"look a like, tease a like\"... lol\n",
      "This place is not that busy, that means food will be dried out forever and turn around time will be ever.\n",

The food was meh...it was all right.  But the property is run down.  I mean the chairs are falling apart, the carpet was dirty, tables are peeling off.  I mean come on, the restaurant needs some type of renovation.\n",

      "\n",
      "They surprisingly served breakfast items still (maybe it was brunch) such as bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, sausage, ham, and others. They also have sushi selection, carved turkey, fried chicken, pastas, mussels, shrimp, salad bar, fruit bar, and desserts.\n",

      "I actually skipped the salad which is a first for me and went straight to the crab legs.  They were a bit difficult to eat with no tools at all but they were tasty, not overcooked and horrible like I expected.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The prices here are good. Approx $20 per person. The food is okay. Its fresh and that matters most. I had the prime rip and it was nice and medium rare. The other dishes were not spectacular but better than simply edible. The service was good but the waitress thought we switched out a person. She asked my husband if he was the same guy that was sitting there a moment ago. I guess people try to cheat in these places but c'mon....It was over halfway through our meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I thought the waitress forgot my request for a steak knife (she didn't say anything about it when she was serving the table next to ours) she really didn't. It just took her a while. So I felt bad for mentally berating her for her ignoring my request.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert section was probably the best. Nice chewy cookies. I had an oatmeal cranberry one. They also had a really good peach cobbler that went excellent with vanilla frozen yogurt on top.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "My friend and I decided on Mandalay Bay for the buffet, lines didn't appear long, and the price was decent for what you got at $33 per person. My friend praised the prime rib to the skies, and to my trained eye, it did look perfectly cooked. For myself, I found a decent selection of grilled and roasted veggies, some mediocre cream of mushroom soup, some decent desserts, and plenty of wine that I had just a bit of... decent wine, not the greatest, but a couple notches above two buck chuck. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was pretty good, refills came often, and plates cleared quickly. This buffet was just one of many I plan to try in the upcoming year, and it was by no means the worst, but there are likely more sumptuous buffets out there :)\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stopped by for lunch before going to the shark exhibit. It's nothing special your average Buffett style restaurant. The variety was the same Italian, BBQ, Asian and Mexican. The food  was good but not excellent and the service was typical of a buffet.  It was good to stop by but I am not sure if I will go back again....\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",

Iced tea is NOT brewed (a big \"no no\" in my restaurant evaluation criteria).  Compromise on dessert quality if you need to cut corners but make sure you fresh brew the iced tea.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The best item on the day I visited was the prime rib.  It was tender, had nice flavor and was not bloody so you know they roasted it a while.  The food selection is not as vast as Bellagio, Wynn or M Resort but the price is commensurate with the selection.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The thing that really pulls this buffet down to 3 stars for me was all of the seafood that I tried.  I tried the cioppino, the panko salmon, and some sushi rolls.  I am a seafood fan, but this fish tasted TOO fishy, to the point where I only took a bite of each.  I love sushi, but by no means am a sushi snob (I will even go to a higher quality conveyor belt place and enjoy it), and the bite I took of my roll here made me feel sick to my stomach.  Sushi, in my opinion, should NEVER have a strong \"fishy\" taste, but this sushi did.\n",

      "\n",
      "You could even tip ahead of time. That always makes me nervous - will we get good service? The waitress came right out and took our drink orders. She was constantly picking up plates and filling up our drinks so that worked out great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food selection was varied and good. As with any buffet, nothing was amazing, but they had several fish alternatives, sushi that was made periodically throughout the day, prime rib that was cooked medium rare, salad bar, Mexican, Chinese, vegetables and a dessert bar. Plus tons more. In fact, I filled up my plate once and then saw a completely different section afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd definitely go back if I was in town again. It's a convenient, efficient, relatively inexpensive (for Mandalay Bay area) meal.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food selection is decent, the taste of the food is good enough not to complain but nothing to write home about.  Examples include only bud as a beer option, best item would be the breaded shrimp although there is a lot of breading, and the breads are about as hard as a rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service is real good, quick and on par.  Deserts are definitely not up to snuff, not much selection, the yogurt melts in a few seconds.  Check it out if you are in the area, but would not make a trip just for this.\n",

      "Had this complimentary from staying at the hotel. Food was alright, had a lot of different varieties. We had lunch here. For the price I don't think it's worth it so I'm glad technically it was free for us. Wouldn't go back though. We did leave full just eating pretty much eating what We liked the most. Staff is as friendly and everything seemed clean. Deserts weren't the best either. Even the ice cream was bland.\n",

At $30 per person, the food was not bad at all. We got there at 12 and they still had breakfast items available as well as lunch and thanksgiving lunch items as well. The food was not excellent but was pretty good and I more than had my fill. The prime rib was so tender, though a little dry, but was still pretty good. All the food was hot and I could see the staff constantly checking the food temperature to make sure all was well. There was so much to choose from but I was able to try everything I wanted. They have a good selection though probably not as much as Bacchanal or the buffet at the Bellagio, but you'll definitely get your money's worth. The staff is attentive and always making sure our drinks were filled and tables cleared. Also there was no line to get in to the buffet. Give it a try if you don't feel like waiting at the other buffets. It's actually not bad at all.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "The food was great.  However, I had foot surgery and can't walk.  Where do you seat someone who will have to balance a plate and a walker?  Hint - there was only one table farther from a food. \n",

      "Won't go back until I can walk.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not worth it. Only upside is there weren't too many people there. For such a nice hotel, the food was off. They did have crabs but everything else was alright. Servers were attentive but like I said, weren't too many people. Maybe since it was a weeknight and after the holidays. I'd spend the extra few bucks and dine at Aria, The M, or Cosmo.\n",

      "The main attraction of any buffet is the prime rib, seafood, and desserts.  \"Bayside\" buffet is just average for all three.  The prime rib was overcooked and seemed like it was last night's batch. The very middle of the rib roast was well done!! I probably came at a bad time.  The seafood is pretty decent here.  The Shrimp cocktail are of a very large size compared to Wynn and Bellagio.  The king crab legs (frozen..errr chilled) were split and of decent size as well.  I wouldnt' say they were as large as the ones at Wynn but good enough to enjoy.  The problem I had was that they over salted the legs so it was a little hard to eat.  I don't know if it was done on accident or just part of the preservation chemicals used on the legs.  Moving on, desserts were pretty crappy actually.  Nothing really looked good but taking a waffle cone filled to the top with ice cream was really great for the long walk back to my car!!  Everything else served is your standard buffet, breakfast stuff, pancakes, bacon, eggs, etc.  Nothing to write home about.  I do think for $23.99 you can get max value out of the buffet by just focusing...err \"enjoying\" the more expensive foods and the drinks.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Friends from out of town who were staying at The Hotel asked me to join them for dinner at the Bayside Buffet.  I had been here once before many years ago, and I remembered it as being a good, solid place.  It's pretty much the same now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among some of the things I tires, the Chinese broccoli with lots of garlic was outstanding.  The BBQ chicken pizza was good, too.  The prime rib was standard and was much of the other things I tried from the buffet.  There were no gourmet dishes but there was nothing that was bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have free wine and beer with dinner which may be a plus for some people.  One of my friends did not care for the wine she got but she and her husband were pleased with the buffet also,\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the place it was lacking was at the dessert area.  I ended up with two chocolate cakes and a raspberry cake.  The two raspberry and square chocolate cakes were OK but the chocolate cake cut like a pie wedge was outstanding!  It was quite rich--almost decadent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend this place for someone who's staying at Mandalay Bay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  There are better buffet options available on the Strip but at a few dollars more for the most part.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Eating at the Bayside Buffet is a \"hit-or-miss\" depending on the day and time. The last time I went, it was AMAZING. Our server was attentive, drinks always refilled and the food selection was exceptional. We had prime rib, freshly baked pizzas and extremely crispy fried chicken. After coming here numerous times, the salad bar hardly changes. I even found brown rice and whole grain pasta available (shocker, but I loved the healthy selection). Other times I went, the food was good and mostly fresh but the service was lacking. Drinks hardly got refilled and our server even walked by us and cleaned other tables not noticing that all 4 of us don't have any beverages. Another point of notice was that it wasn't even busy (defined as more than half the tables were vacant). Overall though, I love coming to Bayside Buffet. If the service was consistent, this would be one of Vegas's top buffets.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I thought it was well worth the price. The food was plentiful and good. Prime rib was delicious. You have to know what to pick from these places. The \"stuffed chicken leg\" was obviously store bought chicken cordon bleu. BBQ chicken pizza was excellent. I also like that beer, wine & champagne was included. Desserts were yummy. Overall, well worth the price. Also, if you're paying by credit card, use the self serve kiosks- HUGE time saver and super convenient.  The service was extremely attentive as well. I'd definitely return.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Buffet  $30 -packed as usual.  Nothing outstanding but something for everyone to hit the spot.  Crab legs were cold and just OK, prime rib was chewy but OK, the Chinese items were acceptable.  Sushi available, pasta available, salads, all the usual.  Had expected slightly better quality.  All the dessert we tried were delicious, and there was a sugar free choc dessert which was yum!\n",

      "This place has a beautiful entrance to it and beautiful window openings to the outside so that it feels very tropical.  Most of my stars are for the atmosphere.\n",
      "The food is good. The selection is decent, not that much in comparison to some other buffets.  And they dont have many options for fresh makings by the chefs.  I went for dinner buffet and there was only the guy at the pasta place (which by the way was watery, not al dente and was bland despite the loads of sauce on it)\n",
      "And the sushi was of hard rice!! ugh.  sushi with hard rice is so gross.\n",
      "I probably wouldnt eat here again, but they had decent selections.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Decent enough, but not worth any wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "No complaints about food, but nothing is exceptional. The place was understaffed, our server was inattentive and stressed thanks to another party being difficult. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unlimited mimosa\" ... More like, \"here's one and I'll forget about you until the very end of the meal when I'll ask if you want another one then take forever to bring it out to you.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I like the place, but the dessert is not as good as the other buffets. The selection also leaves a lot to be desired. However, if you like crab meat, this place is excellent. There is also a shorter wait. The people who work here are fast and efficient. Very good crabs, excellent fried shrimp. Excellent short ribs. Good fried noodles. There is also a person who cooks your pasta. Overall I have a positive view.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was visiting the shark reef (which was fantastic) but since it was near dinner time, we decided to  hit up the buffet. There was no line, so that was nice but there's a reason for it. The food overall wasn't that great and even my baby didn't like the food either (and she's not typically a picky eater). She would not eat anything :(. I noticed the food was a little hard to chew so maybe that's why. Better to else where and pay a little more for better food and selection, like at the Wicked Spoon (cosmo).\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Will keep this short.  Back from 3 days and nights of Super Bowl  carousing in Vegas, seems like we wind up doing 2 buffets a day when I am with the guys.  We hit Bellagio, Paris and Mandalay Bay buffets.  All I can say is this one can be missed.  Two stars for the food, one star for Lena, a beautiful waitress who was the best I have ever encountered at a buffet.  Attentive to every need, kept it all moving, plates cleared, always asking what we needed, why is she even working there. I digress, skip this buffet and head for Paris buffet.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "PROS:\n",

      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Went for the breakfast buffet.  Lots of variety and good food.  The turkey bacon was way over cooked, not good at all.  I was disappointed bc i dont eat pork but love turkey bacon.  Got a seat with a nice view of the pool. Service was great.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was a decent buffet but nothing spectacular.  It's very nice that there is no hour long wait in line to get in this place at any time.  Your options span the basics.  There is italian, asian, american, and mexican dining options.  They don't serve any breakfast items after 12pm which really sucks.  The prime rib was ok.  The carnitas were pretty good.  I enjoyed the fresh fruit and yogurt.  They had a very good dessert spread but I didn't try anything from it so I can't comment on how good any of it tasted.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tons of variety and unlimited champagne!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This was definitely worth the price in my opinion. Some of the food was better than others, but on average everything was good. \n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed to have almost every type of meat that you can think of and various food genres. The specific night I was here it was american, asian, mexican, and italian. They had a sushi station setup and custom ordered pasta. The dessert bar is also quite extravagant. It was full of various pies, cake, puddings, soft serve ice cream, and cookies, both regular and sugar free. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason why I didn't give this place 4 stars was the table service was a little slow to get things like drinks and extra silverware, but it was no way impactful enough for me to not come back the next time I am here.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Oh man, this was the biggest disappointment of Mandalay Bay....It's such a nice hotel and their casino is beautiful that you just kind of expected the buffet to have a good value too....\n",
      "The only upside was that we actually didn't have to pay because we had a $50 food credit but had I had to pay for this....I would have been pissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess most people enjoyed the unlimited beer, wine and champagne....but for someone that doesn't drink much it's not that amazing. Plus you can drink in the casino all day and night. It's cheap wines anyways so couldn't they have a better selection besides just chardonnay and it was either merlot or pinot. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously for the sushi section....I definitely expected a lot better....Salmon is so cheap and they didn't even have that....they had dried up tuna and imitation crab looking thing....\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I liked their mashed potatoes the best....and that just doesn't say much for a buffet at such a gorgeous and pricey hotel....\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think they get a lot of business and that's probably why most of their food was dried out...We should have just gone somewhere else....but we wanted something quick and casual.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part was the desserts....what is that whole section of garbage!? The frozen yogurt or soft serve ice cream....what ever the hell that was....it was the nastiest thing I've ever had.....Old Country Buffet can even do better.....\n",
      "\n",
      "At least the service was decent. The bartender had the best service lol\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Had a food comp for this place and wanted a BIG meal before I got on the plane. Maybe not the best idea, since I felt like i needed to drop a massive bomb after eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought it was OK... lots of variety.... sushi, prime rib, spring rolls, pot stickers, baked ravioli, shrimp, lasagna, pizza, empanadas (not that good), salad. And a decent dessert buffet with cobbler, cheesecake, apple turnovers amongst others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great for free.. not great if you have to pay full price.\n",
      "And luckily no disgusting buffett farts.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah... this place is OK. I went back twice during my Vegas trip. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have average buffet food...for dinner they have pizza, salad, sushi, fruit, roast beef, fish, crab legs, dessert, etc. For breakfast they have eggs, bacon, cereal, eggs Benedict, fruit, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it reasonably priced and good, not great. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, if I wasn't staying at the Mandalay Bay.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This buffet...in the land of buffets....is pretty standard. Hubby and I were able to walk in and be seated fairly quickly for dinner. The dishes they had weren't bad...but nothing really stuck out either. The carved station featured both prime rib and turkey. The prime rib was a bit overdone for my tastes...but it didn't have bad flavor. The turkey was pretty good and the hubby really loves turkey. (He was deprived turkey as a kid at Thanksgiving and other holidays...as his family doesn't like it, so he goes ga-ga for turkey) They did have king crab legs as well as snow crab...I of course went for the king crab and he surprised me and went for the snow crab. The king crab legs were kind of mushy...and just not very flavorful...kind of a bummer for me. He was busy cracking away at his snow crab...and offered me a bite of it. Wow...stand out of the evening! I shamelessly ditched my sad, tasteless plate of king crab legs...and bee-lined it to the snow crab. So sweet, so flavorful...really melt in your mouth goodness in a shell. After indulging in more snow crab than I probably should have, we perused the dessert section. They offered a ton of items including sugar free items...sadly nothing was remarkable. \n",
      "Service was kind of a miss for us that night. At first the hubby ordered pineapple juice and water...he got his water.....and it took 3 times of us asking for the pineapple juice before it finally arrived. I sat with empty water and soda for a while...but we noticed our poor server had the party from hell...(20 top.....with 15 kids) So we definitely cut him major slack for that and once we got refills and the pineapple juice the service kind of picked up...plates removed promptly enough given the circumstance. All in all it was just \"a-ok\" with only a few dishes being good-great and the rest kind of ....in the middle. I don't think we would return to this buffet only because the vast amount of food in Vegas...but it was cheap eats and a nice time with my guy.\n"

I also liked that they had flavored syrups. Our server was on his game as well. We returned for lunch and I was disappointed. Too much seafood (I don't eat seafood) and not much of anything else. The deserts were sub par and the service was just ok. I would return for breakfast and that's about it.\n",

The prime rib was a bit over cooked, but it had a ton of flavor; the blintzes were soft and the cheese had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.   The other items were a bit hit-or-miss, but over all a great deal ($23.00 for a champagne Sunday brunch).\n",

Our server brought our drinks out right away and was very friendly. The food was pretty standard but nothing was bad either. The layout was very strange though. For example, the entrees were not marked correctly and they had breakfast and lunch mixed together. Scrambled eggs were next to meat balls and I was so confused. The french toast, bacon, and fruit were great and I was left feeling full and satisfied so that's all that matters. Was it outstanding? No but it wasn't bad by any means.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "I usually never go to buffets in Vegas however we got comped the buffet at the Mandalay so we basically had to go here. The food is mediocre. They also basically false advertise the prime rib. They don't always have prime rib, the day we went they had something called steamship. I had never heard of this cut of meat before but me as a surgical anatomist and an aspiring butcher I looked into it. Steamship is the top round cut of meat with the femur bone included. This is a lean, cheap primal cut of meat. This is very very different than prime rib. It still tasted good but it is not prime rib. The crab legs were salty and scrawny. Overall disappointing however most buffets disappoint me anyways.\n",

It was creamy and sweet-you could really taste the corn which I really enjoyed.  I mainly had a lot of veggies here bc I was overdosing on meat the entire weekend.  I liked the bak choy in the asian station, and the green beans & tomatoes were a nice side with my breaded chicken & cheese dish.  What I liked was the pasta cooking station.  I had bow tie pasta, with shrimp, onions, mushrooms, with a combination of their alfredo sauce & tomato sauce, topped off with fresh tomatoes.  This was actually pretty good and I couldve eaten the whole bowl had it not been one of the last things I went for.  Meat was OK.  Liked their rotisserie chicken & grilled steak.\n",

We ate fish, snow crab legs, warm and cold; shrimp cocktail; prime rib; make your own pasta; Mexican food; tons of different options.

It has a smoky flavor that is unmatched. Try it topped with hoisin sauce and you could make a delicious meal out of just that. Otherwise, the MORE Buffet at Luxor is much better for variety and taste of food than this place. Generally, the food here is pretty generic. I admit I just go for the convenience when staying at Mandalay Bay...and that pork fried rice!  Plus the service here is always friendly and efficient bringing our drinks and removing used plates.\n",

If you want a top tier, 5 star buffet you can have one at the Cosmopolitan or Bellagio, but that's not what you're paying for here. I thought their brunch buffet was reasonably priced for the selection. I believe it was $64 with a 15% tip added. They had crab legs which were decent. Not all of the food was amazing, but again, it's about what I expected. Come here with mid range expectations and you'll be fine.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dinner - I felt this left a lot to be desired. The highlights include their version of cioppino, which had three different kinds of shrimp and imitation crab meat. The tomato broth was amazing. They also had snow crab legs, which if you take the time to add some of that to the cioppino, brings it up a level (but makes it colder). The low-lights were the prime rib, which was brown and way over done. The flank steak was tough and not flavorful. The pasta station didn't make any sense and didn't tell you what the options were. All of the bread\\/rolls were hard. Even the desserts were just ok. Their tiramisu was made it cute little chocolate cups but the lady fingers were soaked and soggy from the coffee at the bottom. \n",

Traditional breakfast things like eggs, french toast, breads, fruit dishes, & oatmeal can be found in abundance. They also had a number of seafood options including crab, sushi, and one other white fish which I thought was particularly unpleasant. There are also plenty of options in terms of desserts. The little tiramisu cups are a favorite. I was happy these seemed to be ubiquitous in Vegas. \n",

Actually, that's a lie.  Their COOKIES-- mmmmmm... They're big and soft and oh so divine.  The white chocolate cherry is my favorite (whispers: I took some home).\n",

      "Honestly, I enjoyed myself. It's not like buffet food is everything you've ever hoped for and more. But it's definitely one of the better spots to go, so if you don't want to spend $30, this $23 buffet brunch (on Sundays, Mimosa's included!.... endless mimosas... insane) is totally worth it. \n",

While there were a lot of choices, the taste of food wasn't the best. There were a lot of things that looked good, but just weren't satisfying. I would however take advantage of the bottomless champagne on the weekends. The servers are very good about topping off your glasses so you get your money's worth. I would recommend this buffet over a regular casino restaurant because it costs the same but you get more food.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is for the Friday brunch buffet. The buffet options are great,  and the fact that there was crab is a big plus.  Downside is the quality is bad.  The steamed crab was over cooked, the eggs Benedict was bland, the prime rib over seasoned but tender. I did like the teriyaki trip tip. I'm glad that it was a comped buffet, or I'd have been extremely dissapointed.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------\n",
      "Solid three stars. Nothing too fancy and the food is good. Had good service and it was quick and convenient. Ok value for the money. Not one of the top buffets but not the worst either I've ever had. Went there for a quick dinner on a Friday night after tearing down a trade show booth. Just walked in and was seated immediacy and was given good service. Food was for the most part fresh and plentiful.\n",

The 2 areas were similar by 75% with the same foods and differed by 25% with a different in choices. Meaning while both sides had eggs, waffles, and pancakes.

Fresh made to order omelets in the morning and of course, prime rib at night. The wait staff was very friendly and kept our table clear of dirty dishes. Pretty good variety of food to choose from but was surprised they didn't have my favorite french dressing for salads. Other than that, my only other complaint was the prime rib being extremely too rare for my taste. The quality of the food was fairly decent, and the ambiance was pleasant. Despite the negative reviews, I'd definitely come back when I'm in town, again.\n",

Staff was polite and our dishes were cleared quickly. Their food just seemed mediocre. I usually love desserts, but I only picked a few and I wasn't too excited. I would come back using MyVegas, probably wouldn't pay for it though.\n",

      "I came closer to 8:00 to avoid the ridiculous line that forms around 6:00. i got through the line pretty quick but the visit started out shaky. The hostess told me that a sever would take my drink order. So I waited at my table for my drink order and a woman comes up tells me her name and literally throws my straw at me and asks me if i wanted a drink. She seemed to very irritated. I sat there shocked and I noticed that a couple sitting in a table across stared and sat their open mouthed shocked as well by how rude she was. I asked for a Pepsi and she went on her way. After she left the woman from the other table said \"well I guess you are going to get the same service as us.\" Apparently she was rude to them too. Honestly, I could care less after i got my drink. I thought i did not really need her for anything else. As i went to help myself to the food I saw there was quite a variety of different foods. They had Mexican, Spanish, Asian, Italian, salad, soups, prime rib, and best of all crab legs! of course I made a beeline for the crab legs. I grabbed some and some salad for my first place. The crab legs were great! The meat was tender and good. I was trying to crack the legs myself by breaking them in half with my hands when my lovely waitress ran by and dropped a crab leg cracker at my table. After that she was totally different toward me. So attentive and nice. It was like a different person. I don;t know, my guess is because I did not really ask her for anything but a drink in the beginning? Don;t really know. But when I went for a second plate I helped myself to more crab legs and some fried rice and a pizza slice. The pizza was ok and the fried rice was gross. I really liked the crab legs though. now for dessert. I went and grabbed some butterscotch cookies that just looked good and they were the best cookies I have ever eaten. I eve took some with me! LOL. I know that is bad but they were that good. The ice cream sucked. Honestly by the time I left I was more than satisfied with the crab legs and butterscotch cookies. \n",

Having more butterscotch cookies as a holiday treat could not hurt either. The line was long but once I got in and seated it wasn't bad. Got my drink pretty quickly. Went and grabbed some prime rib and crab legs first. The prime rib was just ok, Nothing to write home about, I grabbed more crab legs and after that went for the butterscotch cookies. They were just as amazing as last time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, with the exception of the crab legs and butterscotch cookies everything was either looked kinda gross or was gross. I don't think I would advise someone to spend $30 just to try a couple of things. Go for it if you want to. I might go back I might not. I mean the crab legs suffice as a good meal for me.\n",
